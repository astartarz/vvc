    <TeaserText>Post 9/11 GI Bill® and Vocational Rehab have tremendously helped me to be able to attend Oregon Tech</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where are you from? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, I am from Russia. However, I have lived in Oregon since 2001. I lived in Virginia for six of those years because the Navy stationed me there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Veteran status/branch of military and rank upon leaving:&lt;/strong&gt; Damage Controlman/ E3/Navy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awards/Accomplishments while at Oregon Tech:&lt;/strong&gt; ASOIT representative for the Dental Hygiene Program &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech because the Dental Hygiene program comes highly recommended. I wanted to get a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree and I will be able to do that at this school. After coming back from Virginia, I wanted to stay in Oregon and go to school here because I love this magical state. I was ecstatic to get accepted into the Oregon Tech Dental Hygiene Program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did the Post 9/11 GI Bill&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; option at Oregon Tech influence your decision to come here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, absolutely. Post 9/11 GI Bill&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; and Vocational Rehab have tremendously helped me to be able to attend Oregon Tech. I would not be at this school if I did not have that financial backing. I would attempt to get into cheaper community colleges that offer associates degrees in my field of interest. I am beyond blessed and thankful to have VA in my corner. I hope that one day I can repay back all the goodness that they have done for me and help treat my fellow veterans through dental work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love that I am constantly learning something new. I like the challenge and I like that my program has caring instructors that will help me be successful in this field. I know that I am getting the best education I could possibly get. In addition to that, my program has a lot of community health outreach in which I am looking forward to getting to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, I would want everyone to be able to get dental care regardless of their financial situation. I grew up in poverty and dental care as a child for me was nonexistent in our country. I hope that one day everyone in the world can have the right to dental care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community Dental Health because I will get to be involved in the community through dental treatment, oral health education and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I would like everyone to know that we are offering very low cost cleanings, x-rays, sealants, oral cancer screenings, fluoride treatments and much more at our dental hygiene clinic. We are located in Semon Hall 218.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan on working in public health or in a private dental office. I will definitely stay in Oregon however, not sure what my exact location will be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find Klamath Falls campus to be a peaceful place. I was caught off guard how much it snows here and I was having a hard time getting to school in my Toyota Camry. So to the future students from out of the area be prepared to come to school and make sure your vehicle is up to par for the snow conditions. &lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>Choose a major that sparks your curiosity, and even if you have to take one or two “bad” classes, it will be easier to get through them because you will be excited for the rest of the classes</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awards/Accomplishments while at Oregon Tech:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul style="margin-top:0;"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;President&amp;rsquo;s list for two terms&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Awarded the Coleman Family Scholarship and Presidential Scholarship&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;TOP Honors Student&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
    Why did you choose Oregon Tech?
    &lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech because I wanted a technical approach to my education. As a math major, I wanted to learn the uses of my favorite subject in classes with a direct application to my future career as an analyst. As opposed to other universities, Oregon Tech promised this type of education centered on Applied Math. So far, Oregon Tech has kept this promise and I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed learning the skills I will need in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
    What do you like most about your program?
    &lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many people don&amp;rsquo;t like math because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem applicable. But, since Oregon Tech offers the Applied Math program, students can learn how math is applied everywhere. The math professors center their lessons on applications and are happy to entertain ideas of where and how math can be applied. The biggest complaint you hear about math is &amp;ldquo;When are we even going to use this?&amp;rdquo; But in my program, that question is answered daily, and that is my favorite aspect of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
    What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?
    &lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Math has such a bad connotation among people. While it can definitely be frustrating at times, it also answers the world&amp;rsquo;s most asked questions. If I could change anything in the math field, it would be how people view math. I hope to show others that math can be an eloquent solution, rather than a last resort, to everyday questions, as well as questions that have yet to be answered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
    What would be your dream job?
    &lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My dream job would be to help my employer with their math- related questions. Whether that is by calculating the efficiencies of products, analyzing data to answer research questions, or numerous other questions that the world needs answers for. I want to use the skills that I&amp;rsquo;m learning now to help others (e.g. employers, peers, or students) understand how math is used to answer their questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
    What have been some of your favorite classes and why?
    &lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, my favorite classes have been the Calculus series and some geomatics courses, particularly Computations and Platting. These have been my favorite courses because of how applicable math is in them. The reasoning behind the Calculus series is obvious, but I&amp;rsquo;ve really enjoyed how math is applied in land surveying. Surveyors use geometry, algebra, and calculus to do their jobs. I enjoy the practical use of these math courses that tend to be overlooked or hated because they seem &amp;ldquo;pointless.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
    Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?
    &lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone should know about how many resources are offered at Oregon Tech to help students succeed. For example, there&amp;rsquo;s the Tutoring center, Career Services, and the Tech Opportunities Program (TOP) for first-generation and/or low-income students. There are also many resources in the library, such as laptops available for checkout, research services, whiteboard tables, etc. Coming to Oregon Tech, I was surprised how many resources were available, but am grateful for them, as these resources have helped me with quite a few classes. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
    Are you involved on campus?
    &lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m currently a Peer Consultant in the Tutoring Center. My job is to help students with their understanding of their coursework. Students can make appointments or walk-in for help on homework and studying for their classes. The Tutoring Center has helped me with difficult classes, and in return, I enjoy helping others in the same situation. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
    Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?
    &lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, my plan after graduation is to find employment as a Research Analyst. This career only requires a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree, but I may decide to attend graduate school, for more knowledge and experience in a specified field. I hope to remain on the West Coast, but am open to many career options as an analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
    Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?
    &lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; For future students, who are undecided of their major: Look through the required classes for the majors that sound the most interesting. I was able to find a major that was best for me by looking at the courses offered in the majors I was interested in and narrow down my choice by seeing the number of classes I would enjoy for each major. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking through the required classes of a major and a majority of classes sound boring and/or dreadful, that may not be the best major for you. Choose a major that sparks your curiosity, and even if you have to take one or two &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; classes, it will be easier to get through them because you will be excited for the rest of the classes. College is a chance for you to expand your knowledge in a topic that inspires you. Don&amp;rsquo;t waste the experience torturing yourself with uninteresting classes. Also, if you enjoy learning the skills needed for a career, isn&amp;rsquo;t it reasonable to assume you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy that career? If you hate the classes that give you the skills for a career, why would you like that career?&lt;/p&gt;

    <TeaserText>I chose Oregon Tech because it is an inclusive university that beds creativity, multiculturism and innovation with one of the top 4 best Renewable Energy programs in the United States</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech? &lt;/strong&gt;Each person in this world is born with specific characteristics, strengths and unique qualities that define them. I&amp;rsquo;m a person that is eager to understand teamwork structures and Oregon Tech has given me the scenarios to excel and improve as a person and engineer. I chose Oregon Tech because it is an inclusive university that beds creativity, multiculturism and innovation with one of the top 4 best Renewable Energy programs in the United States&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you like most about your program? &lt;/strong&gt;As a graduate student, I found fascinating the opportunity to discuss with high skill experts in the field, the professors are the ones that make this program attractive, their expertise and their willingness to share, discuss, create projects along with students is what I like the most about the program. This is a university that is always inviting you to think outside the box, to go against the current and propose alternative solutions to existing issues. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/strong&gt; Renewable Energy engineers are characterized by having a holistic view of the energy field. Even though this program focuses on the renewable energy technologies, it also teaches thoroughly how to integrate current energy practices with alternative energy processes; exposing us in a field that is seeking for changes that require the capacity to understand and incorporate both traditional and renewable energy practices to achieve sustainability. As for me I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about improving energy planning strategies, understanding teamwork structures and innovating energy strategies to fulfill my passion for effectively leading energy projects where both fields must work together.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/strong&gt; Being an Energy Analyst &amp;ndash; where the holistic view will allow me and my team to integrate knowledge from different areas of expertise proposing practical solutions to future energy requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why? &lt;/strong&gt;I honestly have enjoyed all of them. Each class has given me a very particular knowledge of the field that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have before. &amp;nbsp;However, If I must pick I will go with Electricity Markets, Solar PV and research and innovation. These classes have built me as a professional integrating renewable energy knowledge with research and innovation strategies while understanding the Business/Market -Economic-Technical aspect of the field.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about? &lt;/strong&gt;Yes, this has become my second home. As an international, immersion into a new culture can take time, this university has very caring faculty and staff that is ready to push you, motivate you and guide you to achieve your professional and personal goals.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you involved on campus? &lt;/strong&gt;Yes, I am.I work for the EERE department as a graduate assistant and research assistant.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech?&lt;/strong&gt; When I was part of the International Department, I had the chance to work for Klamath Falls campus for the summer. During those 3 months, we were able to create the &amp;ldquo;ISS Communication plan&amp;rdquo; strategy for the institution that is aimed to systematize communication procedures for the international community.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about the campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, I invite incoming students to reach out to their future professors, to use the platforms such as student services, and to contact our student ambassadors. This is key at the time of making the right decision for which program to study.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awards/Accomplishments while at Oregon Tech&lt;/p&gt;

    <TeaserText>At only 20 years old, Olga graduated with highest honors from Oregon Tech’s MLS program in December 2018, the youngest in her class.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;Volha &amp;ldquo;Olga&amp;rdquo; Uhlianitsa was introduced to Oregon Tech through her high school guidance counselor who was familiar with the university&amp;rsquo;s Portland-Metro High School Transition (HST) Program. The HST allows high school students to access Oregon Tech coursework for only $25 per credit hour, encouraging college and career exploration while lowering costs for families. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olga was an extremely motivated, high achieving student who attended Clackamas Web Academy, accessing accelerated coursework through Clackamas Community College (CCC). She had a passion for STEM and learned about Oregon Tech&amp;rsquo;s Medical Laboratory Science program through her sister. Working closely with Oregon Tech&amp;rsquo;s HST Program and CCC, Olga was able to complete all of the prerequisite coursework needed to apply to the MLS program. Some of these courses included 300/400 level Biology courses such as Immunology and Medical Microbiology, but that level of difficulty didn&amp;rsquo;t stop Olga from working towards her career goal. &lt;/p&gt;
Through a competitive application process, Olga was admitted to Oregon Tech&amp;rsquo;s MLS program while she was also receiving her high school diploma. Two years later, at only 20 years old, Olga graduated with highest honors from Oregon Tech&amp;rsquo;s MLS program in December 2018, the youngest in her class. Also impressive was Olga being chosen by her classmates and faculty as the &lt;strong&gt;Outstanding Medical Laboratory Science Student&lt;/strong&gt; in their graduating class; awarded to students who are professional, respected by peers, dedicated to helping others, and have technical ability, initiative, integrity, and communication skills. Olga has already received at least one job offer in Oregon, a field in which Oregon Tech graduates are earning average &lt;em&gt;starting&lt;/em&gt; salaries of about $56,000 a year.&amp;nbsp;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>If it wasn’t for the professors, this program would not be among the best in the nation, they are the unsung heroes of Oregon Tech. </TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awards/Accomplishments while at Oregon Tech: &lt;/strong&gt;4 Year Oregon Tech Baseball player, multiple Dean and President&amp;rsquo;s List appearances, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?
    &lt;p&gt;Originally, I chose Oregon Tech because I was drawn to the medical imaging modalities and I could play baseball at the collegiate level. Upon arrival, I realized that the imaging modalities were definitely not what I wanted to do. I stumbled upon the Respiratory Therapy program and the rest was history. That choice turned out to be the best decision to date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;What do you like most about your program?
    &lt;p&gt;The thing I enjoy most about my program is the personal relationships built with the professors. I don&amp;rsquo;t think of them as traditional educators, but more as mentors. They go above and beyond what the curriculum requires, and they provide sound advice about life and personal decisions. If it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for them, this program would not be among the best in the nation, they are the unsung heroes of Oregon Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?
    &lt;p&gt;I am passionate about cultivating a new culture in respiratory therapy with my cohort. Traditionally, RTs were looked down upon and did not have many responsibilities. I feel that our class is much more capable and is going to pave the way for more autonomy and responsibility in the medical workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;What would be your dream job?
    &lt;p&gt;My dream job would be performing helicopter transport with my degree. I want to be there for a patient&amp;rsquo;s worst day and use my education and clinical skills to give them the best possible chance to see another day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?
    &lt;p&gt;My favorite class has been CHE 360 (Pharmacology) because it was by far the most challenging class I&amp;rsquo;ve ever taken at Oregon Tech. That class pushed me to my limits and gave me perspective on how hard my classes really are. It was the most gratifying because I ended up pulling an &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; out and showed me that I&amp;rsquo;m capable of much more than I ever thought I could be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?
    &lt;p&gt;The respiratory therapy program, Oregon Tech&amp;rsquo;s best kept secret. Oregon Tech is known for the engineering and imaging degrees, but in my opinion, the respiratory therapy program is the least talked about and most rewarding program here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing about the respiratory therapy program is the high job placement rate. There is a high demand for RTs so I don&amp;rsquo;t have to get sucked into a hospital I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be at. Right now the focus is to graduate, then I&amp;rsquo;ll see where the wind takes me. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I enjoy being involved with the on campus Radiologic Science Club...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech because I wanted to boost my knowledge in a hands-on learning environment and secure a stable career. Oregon Tech offers a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s Degree in Radiologic Science, one of the only schools to reputably do so on the West Coast. With its partnership with Sky Lakes Hospital, Oregon Tech allows its medical students to perform observations in our fields of study. Also, Oregon Tech is a campus that is open to growth; it evolves with the time and the needs of a student entering a technologically-dependent society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like best about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a sophomore in the Radiologic Science Program, I enjoy being involved with the on campus Radiologic Science Club and spending time in the state-of-the-art laboratory suites. The faculty is supportive with both academic and non-academic goals; doing their best to help students exceed their potential. And, the best part is, all of this is done with like-minded and dedicated students.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job in your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Throughout my life, I have sustained four concussions and all of them played a part in finding my passion and career: healthcare. My dream job would be to become a Magnetic Resonance Imaging Tech that is specialized in imaging Brain Trauma. With this, I could bridge my volunteer service of Athletic Concussion Awareness and education with my career.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love to spend time outdoors! Klamath is wonderful for bird watching, hiking, camping, boating, bonfires, snowy activities, and so much more. Crater Lake National Park is less than two hours away&amp;hellip;and also, just over the hill there is enough tax-free shopping to satisfy anything that the heart desires.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your most memorable moment on campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This year, fellow medical student Megan Cook and I hosted Oregon Tech&amp;rsquo;s First Annual Mr. OIT Pageant benefiting the Children&amp;rsquo;s Miracle Network Hospitals. We raised over $650 for this phenomenal organization in addition to a $500 scholarship for our winner. This was a great event and definitely one of my favorite moments on campus thus far.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="Box"&gt;&lt;img style="float: right; width: 125px; height: 188px; border: 2px solid #d8d8d8; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 10px;" alt="Miss Oregon, Allison Cook" src="https://oregontechsfstatic.azureedge.net/sitefinity-production/images/default-source/student-profiles/miss-oregon-allison-cook.jpg?sfvrsn=9c55bf60_2" /&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Miss Oregon 2013 - Allison Cook (Southern Gem)&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p class="Quote"&gt;"To be representing a state such as Oregon is such an honor and I cannot wait to begin my year of service with Children's Miracle Network, the Red Cross and promoting concussion awareness."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5&gt;Read more: &lt;a href="http://www.oit.edu/news/2013/07/03/oregon-tech-student-wins-miss-oregon-2013" title="Allison Cook, junior at Oregon Institute of Technology"&gt;Oregon Tech Student Wins Miss Oregon 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Read more about Oregon Tech&amp;rsquo;s accolades and university achievements at &lt;a href="/news/university-accolades-rankings" title="University Accolades and National Rankings"&gt;www.oit.edu/kudos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br class="breaker" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was drawn to the fact that the MSREE program is the first of its kind in the United States. The curriculum offered at Oregon Tech really matched my career goals, so there was no doubt in my mind that Oregon Tech was the right choice for me. Additionally, I noticed that the faculty at Oregon Tech has a wide range of experience in the professional world, and that is appealing to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like best about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The broadness and versatility of classes offered within the program. Because I have a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s Degree in Mechanical Engineering, this program is the perfect fit for me, since I am finally applying the theories that I studied during my undergrad in the useful projects that I am currently involved in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job in your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Working as a consultant has always been my dream job. I would love the flexibility of reporting to myself and holding myself accountable for my work as a consultant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m always exploring and enjoying one of the many activities that the Great Outdoors of the Northwest has to offer. Also, the campus in Wilsonville is convenient for enjoying the spirit of Portland - farmer&amp;rsquo;s markets, micro-breweries and food carts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your most memorable moment on campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;When some fellow students and I were able to charge a cell phone from a solar panel using a simple circuit that we designed.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech because of the small class sizes and student to teacher ratio; the teachers also care about the students. It seemed perfect for me because Oregon Tech has the small school feel like a private school, but the tuition and benefits of being a public university. Oregon Tech seemed to have the best program to prepare me for medical school. Lastly, when I visited I felt like I belonged at Oregon Tech because of the great community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like best about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like my major because of the variety of classes in the Health Science major. It challenges me and gives me an edge over students from other schools applying to medical school. I love learning about the human body and the teachers are very passionate about the subjects and care about their students.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job in your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job is as a surgeon working in a rural hospital. I also would love to volunteer with Medical Teams International or Doctors Without Borders. I just want to help people anyway I can.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I live on campus so there aren't a lot of things I do off campus, but I enjoy going to the movies with friends. I also love walking downtown to the shops and eating at so many different restaurants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your most memorable moment on campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My most memorable moment was last year, after I had only been in Klamath Falls for a few weeks. My boyfriend and I had just came back to the Res Hall after our first date and we hiked up to the O. We laid in the middle of the O, staring up at the stars. I saw the lights of the city and campus and felt at peace that I had made the right choice to come to Oregon Tech.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I was drawn in by the rich curriculum of the Geomatics Department...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;First of all, I was drawn in by the rich curriculum of the Geomatics Department. From outside, it was well rounded and I believed the school was going to pass through me rather than me through it. I am here now, and my expectations have been more than met. Oregon Tech is just amazing. I&amp;rsquo;m glad I came. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like best about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lab time. There&amp;rsquo;s hands on experience through the lab sessions. This, you can&amp;rsquo;t find easily. There are simulations of real-world problems we learn to solve. I am inadvertently going to hit the ground running when I graduate. There&amp;rsquo;s one-on-one interaction between me and the professors on both academic and personal issues. This adds that human element, given the pressures of academic life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What clubs or activities are you involved with?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a member of the Geomatics and International Students club. I also have the best job on campus as an IT Helpdesk Technician. I fix computers all over campus and help students who call the Helpdesk for help with IT issues. I love it. I get to interact with everyone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What career do you hope to have after you graduate from Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am gunning for a career as a GIS Systems Administrator who understands land surveying techniques. I want to be the link between the land Surveyor and the data that goes online. Someone has to manage and put that data online. I will be that guy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have any advice for incoming students?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;You won&amp;rsquo;t regret coming to Oregon Tech. The atmosphere is very conducive for learning and make sure you get the best out of the professor. They have so much to offer. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to have fun. There are loads of activities on campus that will make for an all-round college experience.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I chose Oregon Tech because it has a strong Geomatics department and supports participation in the MECOP/CECOP internship program...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accomplishments while at Oregon Tech: &lt;/strong&gt;Only student to ever receive NAIA recognition 6 times, Team captain for Cross Country, PLSO Scholarships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Current city: &lt;/strong&gt;Woodburn, OR&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Current job title &amp;amp; place of employment (or continuing education school): &lt;/strong&gt;ODOT in Salem, OR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt;
I chose Oregon Tech because it has a strong Geomatics department and supports participation in the MECOP/CECOP internship program. Also, the small class sizes make classes a lot more enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3 &gt;What do you like best about your major?&lt;/h3&gt;
I love the combination of outdoor fieldwork and computer mapping. Being outside along with performing calculations is the perfect balance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3 &gt;What do you like most about your profession?&lt;/h3&gt;
I enjoy being outdoors and the math and problem solving that is involved on a daily basis. It never gets old!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3 &gt;How long after graduation did it take you to find a job?&lt;/h3&gt;
After I graduated I was encouraged by one of my professors, Jack Walker, to attend Purdue University&amp;rsquo;s grad program in Remote Sensing. It is a 2-year program but I finished in one year while also being a TA in the surveying classes. I got my job at ODOT three months later.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3 &gt;Did you participate in any externships during your time at Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt;
I spent a summer working at Hawaiian Electric Company in Honolulu, HI.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3 &gt;How do you feel your time at Oregon Tech prepared you for your current job/continuing studies?&lt;/h3&gt;
All of the hands-on classes at Oregon Tech really prepared me well for my job. At other schools students learn the theory but at Oregon Tech we were actually working with the instruments starting our first year. The CAD classes were also very important for the work I do and if I had not had those courses, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know what to do. Employers don&amp;rsquo;t have time to train employees so my coding classes at Oregon Tech were really important.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3 &gt;Is there anything you wish you would have done during your time at Oregon Tech that you didn&amp;rsquo;t?&lt;/h3&gt;
I wish I would have taken advantage of the Outdoor Program more. I was busy year-round with track and cross country.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3 &gt;Do you maintain professional relationships with any of your professors?&lt;/h3&gt;
I stay in touch with professors Mason Marker and Jeff Walker. I was also the only woman in my class of 12 students that graduated together and we all keep in touch and still get together.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3 &gt;What advice would you give to a current student at Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt;
My advice is to spend as much time with your professors outside of class, during their office hours. The professors have industry experience and you can learn so much from them, even outside the classroom.</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I believe Oregon Tech’s Health Science faculty is what really makes this program unique and stand out from the rest...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="CallOut"&gt;Post-graduate program:&lt;/span&gt; School of Medicine at the Oregon Health and Science University&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="CallOut"&gt;M.D. graduation year:&lt;/span&gt; 2020&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you doing now, career-wise (or what do you plan to do after graduating)?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am a medical student at the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, Oregon. As of March 2017, I will be entering a yearlong Pathology Student Fellowship in addition to my medical undergraduate training. After graduating I am hoping to enter a general surgery residency, which is currently on the top of my desired specialty list. Ultimately, I plan to practice as a rural general surgeon on the Oregon Coast.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is one thing that you really appreciated about our program at Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Something that really attracted me to Oregon Tech was the anatomy program. The unique opportunity to work with human cadavers is really a great experience. This in addition to the great faculty and courses within the program that helped shape my interest in medicine into an obtainable reality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The program will push you to develop the study skills and foundation to succeed in graduate programs. I am forever appreciative of the mentors and friends I found within the faculty. I believe Oregon Tech&amp;rsquo;s Health Science faculty is what really makes this program unique and stand out from the rest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What advice would you give to a student in our program today?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Enjoy each step of the process of your education. Don&amp;rsquo;t wait until admission to your desired graduate program to be happy. The road to becoming a medical professional is long and arduous, as many of you know, so it&amp;rsquo;s important to be in it for the right reasons. Never underestimate the importance of good mental health. Make time for your loved ones and the activities that keep you sane. As my other colleagues have stated, it gets harder to make that time as you progress through your training, so start those good habits now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5&gt;Profile updated Mar 2017&lt;/h5&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>The level of interaction between the students and the faculty is what I like most about my major...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h2&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Originally, as a renewable engineering major, I chose Oregon Tech because of the intensity of the program. I like how Oregon Tech requires classes that strengthen students in ways other institutions don&amp;rsquo;t. After I changed majors my first year, I found that I appreciated Oregon Tech even more. But one thing remains constant; I always see how programs at Oregon Tech are structured to give students the best possible education in four years. This is very different than a lot of universities that I previewed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What do you like best about your major?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The level of interaction between the students and the faculty is what I like most about my major. As a student within Health Sciences I know there will always be someone willing to help with class, personal, or academic situations. Due to the willingness of the faculty, as a student I feel that each instructor takes pride in their students and are rooting for them to succeed, not making it impossible to do so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What would be your dream job in your major?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job would be to work with the WHO (World Health Organization) or CDC as these careers would tie my four major interests with one another; the ability to help people, the aspect of medicine/health, medical sociology and travel. With the new Oregon Tech sociology program under development, I am surrounded within many new opportunities to expand this dream and a great avenue in which to pursue my dream. Many professors within my department and the social sciences department are always there to help work my interests with one another.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Off campus, one of my favorite things to do is to go dollar bowling on Tuesday and Thursday nights. I also really enjoy volunteering around the community. My favorite volunteering organization would be HEART, a therapeutic riding center located in Klamath Falls. I also enjoy shadowing different health professionals in Klamath Falls and Oregon Tech makes the opportunity to shadow much more prominent due to the presence of the campus so near the major medical facilities of Klamath Falls.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your most memorable moment on campus?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;My most memorable moment on campus so far has been my interactions with professors. I approached a professor about an upcoming major/program and I was met with so much enthusiasm I knew I had made the right choice in both attending Oregon Tech and wanting to be part of this new program. The level of excitement the professor felt towards my interest just reinforced my own interest and excitement. It made me see how much the faculty really does care about the education of their students.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I really want to help bridge the communication gap between IT and health professionals...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;What do you like best about your major? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can't wait to get out there and start applying my knowledge in the health world. I really want to help bridge the communication gap between IT and health professionals to facilitate the move to an electronic medical industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job in your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also have a passion in graphical user interfacing - so often I hear complaints like "it doesn't let me do what I need it to" or "it works but its clumsy and hard to work with." I believe supplying the technology is just a part of integrating it within the environment. Because proper integration and application is so crucial in the medical industry, I'm very interested in responding to problems like these and being proactive during development and usage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I choose to attend OIT in Portland specifically because of proximity. There is also the benefit of being more integrated into the tech business environment of Portland; both through programs and professors, and fellow students - many of which are already in the industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The best thing I like about attending OIT in Portland is their attachment to the local community colleges. Having easy access to both Portland Community College and Clackamas Community College really helps with scheduling and getting prerequisites.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

I like that it caters to working people, and the professors really want to help you learn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like best about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new Robotics class has been great, working with the new robots. The labs in Thermodynamics and Heat Transfer were very valuable to me as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job in your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The night classes and location of OIT were a big draw for me. Once I was enrolled, it was quickly obvious that I made the right choice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;To new students I would say, &amp;ldquo;Take some time to actually enjoy the subjects and material. The workload can be difficult, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth it if you can embrace the knowledge.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your most memorable moment on campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m finishing just in time to start a family! I&amp;rsquo;ve built up a cargo bike to help haul the little guy around, while reducing our carbon footprints and expand my career in the sustainable development field.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am the ASME Student Association Vice-President 2008-2009 and the ASME Student Association President 2009-2010.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;I am on the President's list and have a 4.0 GPA. I also currently work for OIT at the Portland East campus office.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After OIT, I would like to work at a software company, preferably a game company, and develop independent games on the side.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To new students I would say, "Don&amp;rsquo;t go to OIT for anyone but yourself."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Attending OIT in Portland allows me to complete a software degree at a solid school without leaving Portland, and the teachers have a lot of knowledge about their industries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At OIT I have built a Sudoku solver that I thought was cool, as well as a vertical shooter game that is interesting and fun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;View Chris's Video Profile&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" width="425" height="344"&gt; &lt;param name="width" value="425"&gt; &lt;param name="height" value="344"&gt; &lt;param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"&gt; &lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt; &lt;param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/iX_gHFeNBn8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;"&gt;&lt;embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/iX_gHFeNBn8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;"&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I like about OIT is that the small-sized classes help me interact more with students and instructors. This kind of one-on-one interaction is hard to get at other universities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like best about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My advice to new students is, don't underestimate your skills and ability to learn new things. Set a goal for yourself and stick with it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job in your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favorite classes were networking I and II which were all hands-on and helped me understand them better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;After graduation, I would like to work for an IT firm, and possibly pursue my Masters degree.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;em&gt;"I have had a wonderful experience in the Echocardiography program at OIT. I have learned a tremendous amount of knowledge from the program over the years. I&amp;nbsp; did choose the OIT distance learning program for a couple of reasons. One is the great instruction in the program. Secondly, the ability to take classes online is wonderful since I work full-time and can't do a traditional program. I am proud to be in this program and grateful for OIT&amp;rsquo;s efforts over the years to help the students succeed in this program."&lt;/em&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I always have something to do, something new to learn every day and I love it...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Hometown: Sitka, Alaska &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why did you choose OIT?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I knew Diagnostic Medical Sonography was what I wanted to pursue a career in. OIT offers a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in it and is one of the best schools for the major. Our labs are equipped with top of the line ultrasound equipment and our instructors give us a lot of open lab times to practice scanning as much we please.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What do you like best about your major?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like the daily challenges I am faced with in my major. We are the general ultrasound program so we have to stay on our toes 24/7 with knowing different scanning techniques, pathology, etc. I always have something to do, something new to learn every day and I love it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What clubs or activities are you involved with?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am part of the DMS Club on campus and I work Front Desk for the Housing and Residence Life. With my job, I stay involved with different programs and activities on campus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What career do you hope to have after you graduate from OIT?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;After I graduate from OIT, I would love to work at a large hospital somewhere on the west coast. I want to experience the fast paced work lifestyle a large hospital will offer. Down the road, when my life starts to settle down, I picture myself working in a smaller clinic, something not as fast paced.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Do you have any advice for incoming students?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Know what you want. When entering any type of medical major it is important to be passionate about the field because a lot of hard work will be needed when in the actual program. When you first get to OIT, get out there and meet new people. The school offers various programs to attend to give new students opportunities to meet people and get involved.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I like the intense nature of the classroom time.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;I am the President of the ASME Student section at OIT Portland, and also a member of Sigma Alpha Pi.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After graduation I would like to Work in research and development to improve energy efficiencies. Specifically, the capturing and concentrating of thermal energy from the sun to power HVAC systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At OIT I like The intense nature of the class room time. There is no "fluff",as the lesson is presented. Secondly, Staff and Faculty, are focused on the providing the student with the tools to succeed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My MET415 design project that required building an AC/DC power supply, converting a 6 wire stepper motor to 4 wire motor controller and writing the PLC program to automate the operation of the linear actuator. My MET 492 senior project, built with my team, a parabolic cylinder with dual axis tracking to follow the sun&amp;rsquo;s travel through the changes in day and seasons to capture thermal energy. This system has been able to produce hot water at a temperature of 140 degrees F.

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My goal for graduation was to get a job in software since that is what I did for 20 years before starting at OIT. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like best about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m doing exactly what I was aiming for: A Java shop using design patterns and principles developing applications using the latest technologies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job in your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;To new students, Set a pace and keep to it, stretch it a little sometimes because that is what the real world does. Create a schedule of classes and plan ahead. Treat OIT as you would a job you like and it will reflect in your grades. Apply for internships for job networking and experience doing what they would like to do when they graduate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I came to OIT Portland because When I asked other schools about their computer software engineering program, they said &amp;ldquo;Yes, we have one&amp;rdquo;. OIT personnel were actually willing to talk about the various programs and what kind of classes were in them. I found OIT much friendlier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your most memorable moment on campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Junior project and Senior project are both rather fun as you create a software product to learn different aspects of the actual software development cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I am graduating at 55</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am graduating at 55, Magna Cum Laude; it is never too late to start over, again, or even for the first time!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like best about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My classmates were, for the most part, adult learners bringing with them a wealth of knowledge and experience. Also the professors have a modern, current, working knowledge of what is expected. The small class size can&amp;rsquo;t be beat and the associations you will make are invaluable!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job in your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My senior project taught me much about research and writing. This is where we place the &amp;ldquo;rubber to the road,&amp;rdquo; if you&amp;rsquo;ll excuse my metaphor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;After I graduate, I am considering continuing my education, perhaps in the Master&amp;rsquo;s program at OIT.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>Graduated Doctor of Pharmacy program, OSU / OHSU 2013</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="CallOut"&gt;Post-graduate program:&lt;/span&gt; Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) OSU / OHSU&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="CallOut"&gt;Pharm.D. graduation year:&lt;/span&gt; 2013&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you doing now, career-wise?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently, I work for CareOregon which is the largest Coordinated Care Organization in the State of Oregon. We serve roughly 200,000 Oregon Medicaid and Oregon Medicare members. Most of our members are low-income and in the Portland-Metro area. Lots of pharmacists work for CareOregon and we all specialize in different disease states and different sub-populations of people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My specific patient-population are those with Advanced Illness, generally people who have end-stage disease (such as terminal cancer) or functional impairments (such as dementia). I see most of my patient&amp;rsquo;s in their homes and they are usually in my care for about one year before transitioning to hospice or passing away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I enjoy helping my patients access, organize, and simplify their medication regimens. I also enjoy helping people manage their pain or other symptoms. I work closely with nurses, primary care providers, specialists and social workers to help keep these patients safe and comfortable at home. We also help patients clarify their goals of care and honor their choices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there any other achievement or involvement that you'd like to share?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I finished my Post-doctoral training in 2016. Here is the specific project I completed as lead investigator.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goeres LM, Gille A, Furuno JP, et al. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5116378/" target="_blank"&gt;Rural-urban differences in chronic disease and drug utilization in older Oregonians&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;J Rural Health&lt;/em&gt;. 2016;32(3):269&amp;ndash;279&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have also been a co-author of several other published, peer-reviewed papers studying the health outcomes of medications like statins, beta blockers and other anti-hypertensives in older patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is one thing that you really appreciated about our program at Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I benefited from professors knowing who I was and what my career objectives were. I felt that through various projects and even some in-class instruction, I received an education that was customized to my interest in pharmacy, yet very well rounded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At OIT, there was a partnership that happened between me as a student and the faculty; I felt like my triumphs were their success. I also appreciated the professors with clinical backgrounds which gave me a leg-up in a clinical professional school.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is one piece of advice that you would give to a student in our program today?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's always good to get A's but sometimes you learn more when you get a B.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5&gt;Profile updated May 2017&lt;/h5&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The combination of realistic business education and hands-on learning is what made me choose Oregon Tech. Out of all the universities in Oregon, Oregon Tech was the one to give me confidence in knowing that I can learn about the skills needed in a changing business world and put those skills into practice at the same time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love that I have the best of both worlds in terms of Management and Accounting. My major allows me to refine my skills in different areas of Accounting as well as learn about different components essential to running an organization successfully. Those other components so far have been Information Technology, Communications, and Management.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job in your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job in my major would be one where I can interact with other business professionals at an executive level as well as work with the finances and accounting that go in to the operation of an organization or company. Summarized into one title, that would be a Chief Financial Officer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am a part of a young adult group called &amp;ldquo;The 120&amp;rdquo; at Klamath Christian Center. A significant portion of the group is made up of OIT students, and I love being able to come together with them outside of school. I consider The 120 a second family and enjoy activities with them from getting ice cream to hiking around Moore Park.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your most memorable moment on campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My most memorable moment on campus was when I had a great conversation with my Argumentative Writing Professor. He challenged me to look beyond the usual question of &amp;ldquo;how does this class apply to my major,&amp;rdquo; and instead ask the question, &amp;ldquo;how does my major apply to this class?&amp;rdquo; In just that single difference I realized the importance of developing myself as a well-rounded business student rather than just an Accounting major.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech because I really wanted to study Renewable Engineering and it was one of the few universities that offered it. I found their curriculum to be complete.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Renewable Energy because it met most of my interests.

I completed a family medicine internship in 2013 and then started my GMO tour. So far I have been in training in various places around the country and have completed a deployment to Okinawa, Japan where we did exercises in mainland Japan and South Korea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I will be applying for a residency in Radiology this year with the U.S. Navy. They have training programs in San Diego, CA, Portsmouth, VA, and Bethesda, MD. My first choice for this very competitive specialty is San Diego, CA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there any other achievement or involvement that you&amp;rsquo;d like to share?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I graduated in the Top 10% of my class in 2012, as well as received an award for being the top military student during the 2011-2012 school year. Also, I was inducted into the Sigma Sigma Phi National Osteopathic Honor Society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have a publication that has been accepted to the Journal of Thoracic Imaging which will appear in the November 2014 issue.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;Moullet, P &amp;amp; Mann, H Beak sign. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Thoracic Imaging&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is one thing that you really appreciated about our program at Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I feel like it has been said before, but the one thing I admired and appreciated most about the Biology program at OIT was the low student to teacher ratio. This enabled very close support and mentorship from the professors to enable full scope and highly personalized education. It very much reminds me of the book David and Goliath by Malcolm Gladwell where he discusses how going to a lesser known school with a good educational program produces as good as or better students more often than very well known schools with high academic prestige.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is one piece of advice that you would give to a student in our program today?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plan early on where you would like to be in the future and don&amp;rsquo;t let the fact that you are at a small program let others deviate you from where you want to be. The education I received at OIT prepared me for the challenges of medical school and further education with, if not, better than any other school.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5&gt;Profile updated Sept 2014&lt;/h5&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="CallOut"&gt;Post-graduate program:&lt;/span&gt; Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD) at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Sciences University (OHSU) in Portland, OR&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="CallOut"&gt;D.M.D. graduation year:&lt;/span&gt; 2014&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you doing now, career-wise?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a new dentist, I am working in two very different sectors of the dental world to gain more experience serving various patient populations.  I am working as an associate in a private practice in Eugene, OR, and for Willamette Dental in Corvallis, OR.  I am currently learning a lot from both jobs and growing in my career!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is one thing that you really appreciated about our program at Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;When comparing my undergraduate experience to my colleagues in dental school and to my two years spent at OSU, I was really proud to have graduated from OIT.  The small class sizes truly enhanced my learning experience.  For example, at OIT, there were 12 students in my Anatomy and Physiology course.  We were provided four fresh cadavers to learn from via dissection.  Not one of my classmates at OHSU had this experience.  Most schools don&amp;rsquo;t allow undergraduate students to dissect the cadavers.  They were forced to learn from previous dissections that were difficult to preserve.  I learned so much about the human body by doing the dissections myself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, the professors in the Biology and Health Sciences program are incredible!  I took classes from Dr. Clark, Dr. O&amp;rsquo;Shaughnessy, and Dr. Usher.  Each of these individuals has an impressive background, is an excellent teacher, and truly cares about their students.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is one piece of advice that you would give to a student in our program today?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Post-graduate medical programs want well-rounded individuals.  Of course, focus on your studies, but also find other things that you are passionate about, such as sports, community service, humanitarian trips, research, clubs or hobbies!  Don&amp;rsquo;t let your career choice be your entire life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5&gt;Profile updated Sept 2014&lt;/h5&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I will be awarded a DMD and return to practice dentistry somewhere in rural Oregon...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="CallOut"&gt;Post-graduate program:&lt;/span&gt; Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD) at Midwestern University &amp;ndash; College of Dental Medicine in Glendale, AZ&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="CallOut"&gt;D.M.D. graduation year:&lt;/span&gt; 2015&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you doing now, career-wise (or what do you plan to do after graduating)?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently a Staff Dentist at Umpqua Community Health Center in Roseburg, Oregon. Quite a few of my dental classmates would talk about how much money they were going to make as dentists after graduation. As for myself, a career in public health was always the goal. I was drawn to healthcare as a way to make my mark on the world and "do good". Now that I am a dentist, I help people all day long, many who have never had access to dentistry on a regular basis, if ever. I feel so fortunate to have landed my dream job!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there any other achievement or involvement that you&amp;rsquo;d like to share?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m really proud to have been awarded a National Health Service Corp Scholarship. As an NHSC Scholar, I will spend at least my first four years after dental school working with underserved populations. Sure, it has helped alleviate a large portion of my dental school debt, but more importantly, it has allowed me to take a career path that I would have been unable to reasonably consider without their support.
I would also like to say to those other &amp;ldquo;non-traditional students&amp;rdquo; out there, it&amp;rsquo;s never too late to try and change your life!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is one thing that you really appreciated about our program at Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many people cite the small class size and great instructors at OIT as instrumental to their success, and I couldn't agree more. Ultimately though, if you want to pursue a graduate degree, a major factor is the overall quality of preparation for program prerequisites, admissions tests, and grad school coursework that makes the difference. I've honestly lost track of how many times I've paused in the last few years and thought, "Yeah, I learned that at OIT!"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is one piece of advice that you would give to a student in our program today?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Work hard and learn to study effectively. The difference in required effort between undergrad and grad school is immense.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5&gt;Profile updated May 2017&lt;/h5&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I appreciated the small class sizes and the easy access to the professors...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="CallOut"&gt;Post-graduate program:&lt;/span&gt; Doctor of osteopathic medicine (DO), Western University of Health Sciences-Northwest (Lebanon)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="CallOut"&gt;D.O. graduation year (expected):&lt;/span&gt; 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you doing now, career-wise (or what do you plan to do after graduating)?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently, I am attending medical school at Western University of Health Sciences at the Northwest Campus. After graduating, I plan on practicing as either a primary care physician, a critical care specialist, or a hospitalist. No matter which specialty I go into; however, I do plan on integrating holistic medicine into the way I practice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is one thing that you really appreciated about our program at Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My undergraduate education at Oregon Tech was spectacular. I&amp;rsquo;m not just saying that because I was asked to write this Alumni spotlight- I really don&amp;rsquo;t think I could&amp;rsquo;ve received a better education. The quality of the faculty was outstanding and the learning environment was phenomenal. I appreciated the small class sizes and the easy access to the professors. There were many times I sat at the tables on the second floor of Dow when a professor came and sat down with me and asked if I had any questions; I don&amp;rsquo;t know any other school where that occurs. I am more than satisfied with the education I received at Oregon Tech and I owe it all to the professors (with a special thanks to Dr. Usher, Dr. Clark, Dr. Swisher, and Dr. O).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is one piece of advice that you would give to a student in our program today?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m assuming that the students in the Health Sciences/Biology degree are all wanting to go into the healthcare field, so this advice is for all the pre-health provider students. First off, take all of your classes seriously; the information comes up again in medical school, only much more in depth. Secondly, make sure that you are going into the health profession for genuine reasons. Medical school is hard and extremely stressful. And, at the end of your medical education you will be given the power to change the lives of human beings. If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be a doctor/dentist, etc. with everything you have, then I recommend another profession. Lastly, if you know that being a doctor is in your blood, then don&amp;rsquo;t give up. If you are denied acceptance into medical school, then try again. You WILL get in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5&gt;Profile updated Oct 2014&lt;/h5&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I am able to attend school full-time while working my full-time position in management...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech Online?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended Oregon Tech when I graduated from high school and had very positive memories of my time there. When I was considering going back to college, Oregon Tech was one of the first schools that I looked at attending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What do you like best about your major?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have really enjoyed everything that I am learning. Having just been promoted to a management position, I am enjoying learning skills and information that I can directly apply to my current career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What has been the greatest aspect of completing your degree online?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the classes that I am taking are all being offered online, I am able to attend school full-time while working my full-time position in management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What career do you hope to have after you graduate from Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after I made the decision to return to school and complete a bachelor's degree, I received a promotion in management at my current place of employment. I hope to continue in &lt;g class="gr_ gr_276 gr-alert gr_gramm Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="276" data-gr-id="276"&gt;management&lt;/g&gt; where I am currently employed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Do you have any advice for incoming students?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best advice I could give is to make the decision to complete your education and then hold yourself to it. Life can be overwhelming and it is easy to decide to take some time off or even quit for a while. Keep &lt;g class="gr_ gr_278 gr-alert gr_gramm Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="278" data-gr-id="278"&gt;sight&lt;/g&gt; of your goal and break it down &lt;g class="gr_ gr_270 gr-alert gr_gramm Grammar multiReplace" id="270" data-gr-id="270"&gt;by&lt;/g&gt; terms, if necessary, to make your goal seem more reachable.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I plan to graduate with my Bachelor's in Respiratory Care and then continue my degree in Anesthesiology...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The main reason why I love Oregon Tech is because it is a small school. Since I grew up in California there are not many small universities or schools that provide my major, so choosing OT was the best choice I could have made. Since OT is a smaller school, the number of students sitting in one class is not overwhelming compared to classes in a larger city.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I especially love that if I have any questions about my work the professors are always available to answer them in class or during office hours. Oregon Tech is also a diversified college with students from all around the states and countries, so I'm not worried about not being able to meet anyone on campus. Also, everyone is so friendly including people in the Klamath Falls community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the future I would like to become an anesthesiologist and I believe going into Respiratory Care can help lead me to that path.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you plan to do with your degree?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I plan to graduate with my Bachelors in Respiratory Care and then continue my degree in Anesthesiology for my Masters. Going to medical school for anesthesiology is my dream!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would you like us to know about you?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I grew up in a Buddhist family.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I chose Oregon Tech because it offers hands‐on engineering experience...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech because it offers hands‐on engineering experience at a relatively affordable cost compared to most colleges/universities. I also love its small class sizes. When I was in high school, I took a few college classes at Oregon Tech. I liked that all the professors remembered me personally and are always willing to help when I have questions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I was in high school, I had the chance of learning about the engineering field and became interested. I've also always loved Math and Physics and been quite good with these subjects since I was little. I enjoy learning how everything works, so Mechanical Engineering fits my interests and skills.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you plan to do with your degree?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;After I graduate from Oregon Tech, I will either continue my education, or start working as an engineer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would you like us to know about you?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;As officers and members of the &lt;a href="/campus-life/student/clubs/international-club" title="International Club"&gt;International Club&lt;/a&gt;, Society of Women Engineers, Engineering Honors Society, and Engineering Ambassador, I have met a lot of cool people and students here at Oregon Tech. I have gained invaluable experience and skills of communicating and working with different people, organizing events, and working on projects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oregon Tech has provided me with quality education, hands‐on experience outside of class, skills that will prepare me for my future career, and a chance to meet friends that I will keep for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech because of the challenging medical imaging programs offered. It was also important to me to have small class sizes where students have good relationships with instructors, especially in the labs and with the many hands‐on experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have always wanted to be a healthcare professional and chose Nuclear Medicine Technology to help make a difference in someone else&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you plan to do with your degree?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;After graduation, I&amp;rsquo;m planning to go back to Indonesia and work in a hospital that has a nuclear medicine department.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would you like us to know about you?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am an introvert, but I learned how to make friends and to open myself up since I came to Oregon Tech. I am really blessed to be able to spend three years of college here and also thankful for friends, especially the other international students for always encouraging me and for the great friendship we have.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech because the Renewable Energy Program is highly recognized&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5;"&gt;around the world. Before coming here, I searched and found this to be&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5;"&gt;one of the best schools for this major.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oman has so many natural resources for renewable energy and I will use my education to help my&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5;"&gt;country develop this field. I&amp;rsquo;m proud and excited to be the first Omani woman in renewable energy in&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5;"&gt;my country. Renewable Energy has a great future!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you plan to do with your degree?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I will continue my education in the graduate program in project management, and plan to work in one&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5;"&gt;of Oman&amp;rsquo;s solar energy companies.

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech because of how highly acclaimed their Computer Engineering Department is. I researched colleges in the US before coming here and I believe I couldn't have made a better choice!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Programming has been an interest of mine for quite some time. I never pursued it in anyway until I came to Oregon Tech. Coding is fun and the feeling you get when creating something out of nothing is indescribable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you plan to do with your degree?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps get some work experience here in the United States and then go back to Saudi Arabia to work and be with my family.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>The greatest aspect of online classrooms is the flexibility of hours...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech Online?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;After researching several degree completion programs, Oregon Tech&amp;rsquo;s profile fit what I was looking for. The cost was affordable and the flexibility of the online coursework allowed me to work and go to school at the same time. I was also able to take a semester off when I was preparing for my daughter&amp;rsquo;s wedding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like best about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love dental hygiene and have been a practicing hygienist for 24 years before entering the degree completion program at Oregon Tech. Dental Hygiene is a great career for anyone wanting to be in a healthcare profession. Hygienist&amp;rsquo;s don&amp;rsquo;t have to work full-time to make a decent living, so this is what attracted me to the profession because I wanted to be a homemaker and mother when I began my career. Furthering my education will allow me to look for other employment opportunities outside of clinical dental hygiene, like teaching, research, or public health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What has been the greatest aspect of completing your degree online?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The greatest aspect of online classrooms is the flexibility of hours. The student gets to choose when they go to school. I most often did my coursework on my days off or on weekends. Occasionally, I would log on in the evenings after work, but it was nice knowing I didn't have to if I had other obligations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What career do you hope to have after you graduate from Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now that I have my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree I would like to enter a Master&amp;rsquo;s program&amp;nbsp;so that I can become a dental hygiene professor. My professors at Oregon Tech were fantastic mentors and good examples of what college professors should be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have any advice for incoming students?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My advice for incoming students would be to plan on spending anywhere from 6-10 hours per week for coursework, and occasionally more if research papers are due. Additionally, talk with your advisor so that you can have a plan on how to approach your schedule. Have fun and enjoy learning in this wonderful format!&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>The greatest aspect of completing my degree online is the freedom of working at my own pace...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech Online?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have chosen Oregon Tech Online because of my busy schedule. I am working full-time and trying to finish my degree, and going to classes isn't always an option for me. Most of the classes I have to take are at times when I work, so it has been very difficult to take the classes that I need. Now that I am doing my degree online, I have the ability to take any class that I need and have it fit into my schedule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like best about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love that my major offers so many career opportunities. I know that when I leave Oregon Tech I will get a job that I will love, even if I change my mind a hundred times. I can choose to work at the hospital, the school district or even work for the state. The possibilities are endless.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What has been the greatest aspect of completing your degree online?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The greatest aspect of completing my degree online is the freedom of working at my own pace. I get to choose when I do homework and don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about being to class on time or even getting dressed for the day. I can throw on my yoga pants, have a cup of coffee and get the same education.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What career do you hope to have after you graduate from Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;After graduating from Oregon Tech, I hope to have a career in either social work or in child psychology. My passion is working with children and I want to have a career that will give me an opportunity to help children in need.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have any advice for incoming students?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My biggest advice for incoming students would have to be to manage your time well. It seems like a small task, but it is so very important. Being able to manage your social life, &lt;g class="gr_ gr_158 gr-alert gr_gramm Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="158" data-gr-id="158"&gt;work&lt;/g&gt; and school will make everything so much easier. So plan out your week, make sure that you make time for all the things that you want to get done and stick to that plan.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I chose Oregon Tech Online because of the program’s esteemed reputation, realistic expectations and user-friendly appeal...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech Online?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I knew that the most effective way to earn my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree while working full time would be to enroll in an online program. I chose Oregon Tech Online because of the program&amp;rsquo;s esteemed reputation, realistic &lt;g class="gr_ gr_41 gr-alert gr_gramm Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="41" data-gr-id="41"&gt;expectations&lt;/g&gt; and user-friendly appeal. Initially I was apprehensive about online schooling, having no prior experience with it, but from my first contact with Oregon Tech&amp;rsquo;s staff I felt reassured and gained confidence &lt;g class="gr_ gr_40 gr-alert gr_gramm Grammar multiReplace" id="40" data-gr-id="40"&gt;with&lt;/g&gt; the prospects of my success.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like best about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Throughout the progression of my courses, I was able to network with other students and developed a sense of comradery with other hygienists also working towards their bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree. It was really fun getting to know other students in my same profession whose aims were similar to mine in the development of their education and career.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What has been the greatest aspect of completing your degree online?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved being able to do the online coursework at my own pace and on my own timeline. Doing courses online allowed me the flexibility to complete projects while I traveled and worked from my laptop anywhere in the world. I was able to do schoolwork while in Hawaii, Las &lt;g class="gr_ gr_30 gr-alert gr_gramm Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="30" data-gr-id="30"&gt;Vegas&lt;/g&gt; and even Mexico!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What career do you hope to have after you graduate from Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Achieving my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree allows me to further my career as a dental hygienist and has helped me to become an adjunct clinical faculty member at Oregon Tech&amp;rsquo;s dental hygiene program in Salem. In completing this new facet of my education, I feel more empowered and positive about my future as a dental hygienist and feel that many doors for my future are open. Attaining my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree has now even given me the hope of looking forward to completing a master&amp;rsquo;s degree- before I would have never dreamed this possible!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have any advice for incoming students?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My advice for other students would be to take one day at a time, persevere and to never give up. The program can be challenging at times, however, it is said that anything worth achieving will be difficult to overcome. The amazing and gratifying feeling of graduating will be worth the hours spent studying, hard work and dedication to achieving a higher education.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech Online?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Being an athlete, working full time, and now being married, online was the best option for me because I can take it with me wherever I go. Putting myself through college requires me working full-time, so being able to do my homework during a down time at work was beneficial for me. Also being an athlete, I am able to play and coach as well as doing school on the road.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like best about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love that I have awesome teachers who are so devoted to psychology that it makes it so easy to learn. I love that I am able to learn just as much online as I was in the classroom and I still feel like I am in lectures, but I am able to do it on my own time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What has been the greatest aspect of completing your degree online?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am able to work at my own pace from wherever I want. I am also able to still communicate with teachers and students on the online discussion boards as if I were in class. I am also able to work, travel, play soccer, but also do my schooling. I also love the online videos, blogs, and research I am able to do from my computer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What career do you hope to have after you graduate from Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hope to be a sports psychologist so that I am able to to continue my love for sports but also do my newfound love which is psychology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have any advice for incoming students?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My advice would be to not be afraid to email teachers or students if you do not understand something. Also, make sure you check due dates because they are not verbalized to you as they are in the classroom. Also, interacting with students in the discussion section of the class allows you to interact as if you were face to face and provides so many new thoughts and ideas about the topics being discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech due to its diversity in renewable energy topics. This school is unique in that a student can generate specific skills to their interest. The flexibility in project selection and course topics grants the opportunity for a very diverse portfolio.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like best about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Going forward I am the most excited to see how the Graduate REE program develops and the tremendous influence our graduates will have on the energy industry at large.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oregon Tech has a unique degree program that perfectly matches with my career aspiration: Master&amp;rsquo;s in Electrical and Renewable Energy Engineering (MSREE).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like best about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really like some sequences in the MSREE program:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Battery and Energy Storage: the courses give precious knowledge in the hot topic of energy storage. Now, I truly understand the chemical reactions inside batteries, how batteries degrade over time, pros and cons of various types of energy storage (fuel cells, batteries, fly wheels, etc.).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Solar Energy: as a result of taking these courses, I deeply understand the solar industry from how a solar cells works, to manufacturing, applications, and design trade-offs of a solar photovoltaic system.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Research Method and Innovation: I can finally draft a patent application myself after taking the first course in the sequence.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have to say that these sequences gave me indispensable knowledge for my future career.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job in your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is one that not only makes me rich, but is also inspirational and, most importantly, has great, positive contributions to the world. With these criteria in mind, my dream job is, undoubtedly, a job in the renewable energy industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your most memorable moment on campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was when we built a three-phase inverter, staying up late at night in the lab, putting in tons of effort, and seeing it work beautifully.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like to go to vegan restaurants, meet with vegan people, and enjoy the group&amp;rsquo;s activities. No doubt, Portland is the most vegan friendly city in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>When I graduate I will have acquired skills that are needed in every country and will always be needed...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I initially chose Oregon Tech because I have extended family who live here and I am close to home. I then wanted a town that provided a small university and a community college to finish my prerequisites and then transfer; Klamath Falls offered both. Lastly, I heard nothing but glowing remarks about the civil engineering department at Oregon Tech from students, potential future employers, and faculty alike. I couldn't deny the fact that Oregon Tech seemed to have nothing but positive feedback and I can now attest to the accuracy of these statements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like that with my degree I will have the opportunity to travel the world and work across many different cultures. When I graduate I will have acquired skills that are needed in every country and will always be needed. Additionally, one of the simplest reasons I love civil engineering and I decided on this major is because I get to use math to solve real world problems and math really simply makes life fun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job in your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; I am going to college for a degree in civil engineering with a focus in water resources for a very specific purpose. I want to build wells and work in bringing clean water to communities in developing nations. I foresee myself obtaining a master's degree and then going overseas to work with a company like Black and Veatch, under a professional engineer for three years until I can take the PE exam and receive a license.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Outside of school and on-campus activities I love to do anything outdoors with my friends and family. I enjoy bike riding, running, tennis, ultimate frisbee, hiking, and practically anything else that involves exercise and sunshine! In down time I love to read for hours, though I don't find time for this except in the summers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your most memorable moment on campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don't think I can single out just one moment, but I think collectively I have most enjoyed being a part of Christian Fellowship and all of the friendships I have built during Friday nights, road trips, and serving together. I have built some of the closest friendships during these short 9 months in this group. Additionally being involved in other clubs on campus like Engineers Without Borders and Concrete Canoe, and going to campus events like the Golden Gate Bridge Presentation have enriched my learning experience, making me a more well-rounded student.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Above photo courtesy of Miss Klamath County-Miss City of Sunshine Organization&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;They have an amazing Medical Imaging Program and I was given the opportunity to be a part of the track and field team. I've participated in athletics my whole life and it would a hard transition into college without them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I feel that Pre-MIT really prepares students for the challenging courses they will be taking once they're in the programs. They also take the time to make sure that each student is pursuing the right modality and they find one that best suits them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job in your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would love to be a Diagnostic Medical Sonographer in a small hospital or clinic. I think that general ultrasound best suits my skill set and I love the science behind ultrasound.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favorite thing to do off campus is visit Crater Lake. It's always really refreshing to get of our town and marvel at the incredible lake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your most memorable moment on campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My most memorable moment of campus was joining a last minute game of capture the flag at ten o'clock on a school night.

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I originally came to Oregon Tech to take advantage of the accredited renewable energy engineering program. It turned out that engineering wasn't for me after all, so I spoke to Dan Peterson about switching over to communication studies. He was able to utilize all my math and science credits toward my focus sequence electives in my new major, and I am ridiculously happy in this venture!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love how flexible the degree is in terms of coursework availability. The classes are fun, applicable, and small. The professors are incredibly approachable, and not only are you learning from experts in the academic field, but they have extensive industry experience as well. But the best part is how devoted the professors are to their students and will do whatever they can to help them succeed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job in your major? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's difficult to pin down one thing that I could with this major, since it is so versatile, but that's why I chose it. I love that I have set up my major to ensure that I can do a wide variety of things over the years including mediation, document design (graphic), technical writing, human resources, or organizational communication. I could also move on to graduate school in law, psychology, or even public relations. Right now, I would like to gain a reputation as a mediator by starting in a human resources department of a large corporation, since they tend to handle dispute resolution in-house.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than anything, I like to hang out with my two dogs! I enjoy traveling, cooking, spending time with friends, and exploring the basin. I like to meet new people, go on new adventures, and try new recipes, but I also like to stay home and binge watch Hulu!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your most memorable moment within your school career?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would never be able to pin down just one memorable moment. I love that this school, and my major in particular, provide the perfect environment to make amazing friendships that I know will last a lifetime. The people I have met here are such supportive, wise, fun, and intelligent individuals, and I truly believe that the same kind of experience could not be had at any other university.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I love the faculty. I know I could go to any of my professors...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt;
I learn a lot better in smaller classrooms, so that was a really important factor for me. Then when I visited and toured the campus everyone I met was really welcoming, I didn&amp;rsquo;t just feel like a number and everything clicked and it felt right.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love the faculty. I know I could go to any of my professors and get their advice about anything, even unrelated to school.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job in your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have my dream job. I was lucky enough to get three internships before I graduate and test out several areas of civil engineering and find what I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about. I interned with Kiewit Infrastructure Engineers in Denver last summer and loved it so much I&amp;rsquo;m going back! I get to work on multibillion dollar design-build projects, where I optimize design of roadways to help the company win jobs, and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to do anything different!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What activities are you involved in on campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am an ambassador in the Admissions Office, I&amp;rsquo;m president of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), I&amp;rsquo;m involved with the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) and Concrete Canoe (past concrete canoe captain), I&amp;rsquo;m a Women in Transportation Seminar (WTS) scholarship recipient- as such, I get to travel to Austin, Texas for the WTS Annual Conference in May, I was a &lt;a href="/campus-life/activities-events/new-student-orientation"&gt;New Student Orientation&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;group leader and I&amp;rsquo;m also project manager for my senior project group, working on the &amp;ldquo;Downtown for People&amp;rdquo; Blue Zones project in Klamath Falls.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love snowboarding! The &lt;a href="/campus-life/student/programs/outdoor-program"&gt;Outdoor Program&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;has great trips for really reduced prices and I try to go on as many as possible!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your most memorable moment within your school career?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are so many! Probably the most memorable moment was when I got to travel to Washington DC for the Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting. While we were there we got to tour the Capitol and meet our Oregon Representative, Greg Walden. He was really great to talk with and was genuinely interested in our projects and our futures.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech because it gave me the opportunity to pursue something that I loved, which is the environment, and be able to make a difference with the education. Also while getting the chance to further my sports career playing volleyball here at Oregon Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like that it is so hands-on. We get to go on field trips a lot, and be able to apply the skills we learn in class to the real-world environment. I also like the diversity and multiple emphasizes that can be applied to the major, such as fire ecology, watershed, botany, wildlife ecology, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; What would be your dream job in your major?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dream job would be to be a Hydrologist. A Hydrologist is the study of the movement, distribution, and quality of earth&amp;rsquo;s water systems and sustainability. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been interested in conservation and water quality, and this is the perfect job to apply both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy to be outside most of the time. I like hikes, and when I go home I like to ride my horses. I play basketball with my dad and brothers, and play in tournaments. I also enjoy getting to play with my young niece and nephew. Basically anything where I get to be with my family is the best time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; What&amp;rsquo;s your most memorable moment within your school career?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my most memorable moments thus far has been when I got to wade in the Link River for one of my environmental labs. I got wear the big wading boots that came up to my chest and we got to collect macroinvertebrates and then got to analyze them all and classify them. By seeing what specimens we found, we could determine the quality of the water. This was just something that I enjoyed the most.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>One thing I love about software is how many different types of things I can do with it...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a first generation college student, so one of my main concerns for choosing a college was how easy it would be to find a job right after graduation. I wanted to make sure that my investment would be worth it. Oregon Tech is the only school in the Pacific Northwest that offers a 96% employment rate within 6 months of graduating with my degree. I felt I could stay close to home with the comfort of knowing that I could find a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I took my first programming class my first term in &lt;a href="/academics/engineering-technology-management/cset"&gt;CSET&lt;/a&gt;, my professors talked about the "CSET Family." I had no idea what they were talking about until the middle of the term when I was struggling with the difficult concepts and heavy workload. I found that I can ask any student or professor for help and they will help if they can. Now that I'm a junior, other students come to me for help with their coursework. My favorite part my major is that the "CSET Family" pushes me to the limit, and a little farther, to make sure I will be a programmer prepared for any challenge, but they also provide support when it is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job in your major?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I love about software is how many different types of things I can do with it. I could make websites or write the code that controls a pacemaker. My dream is to make a big impact. I'm currently in a startup company that will provide small farmers with access to high technology by creating an inexpensive robotics kit to fit the equipment they already own. The kit will automate the farming equipment and collect field diagnostics to provide live updates for resource management. My hope is not only to make the lives of farmers easier, but to drive down the costs of growing and buying food for everyone. But once I finish with this project, I know that I'll have myriad options to choose from for my career shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To stay physically active, I like to go running, hiking, and biking. Klamath Falls has a lot of trails that it maintains for the community. I also like to stay connected with the goings-on, and I like to watch plays at the Linkville Playhouse or watch symphony concerts at the Ross Ragland Theatre. I like to do my homework away from home, and Gaucho&amp;rsquo;s Collective CoWorking space lets me work out in the community without the noise a caf&amp;eacute; brings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your most memorable moment within your school career?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most memorable moment in my school career was when I finally wrote my first game in C++: Blackjack. This was the first project that I had designed and built myself using what I learned in my other C++ classes. When I placed that first bet in-game, I realized that I am well on my way to being a software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to attend to Oregon Tech because I was interested in ultrasound. Oregon Tech was the only school in Oregon offering a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in ultrasound and I had heard it was competitive and prestigious. So, I decided to give it a chance and am grateful I did! Now, I am in the echo program and study ultrasound, specifically of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love being able to watch the heart move live on the ultrasound monitor. It's so intriguing! Also, my professors are awesome. They are constantly pushing me to succeed and encouraging me every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job in your major?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be an echocardiography technologist. Someday, I want to be a traveling technician; to be able to perform heart scans in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the late nights of studying, I loved taking a quick trip down to the Night Owl with friends for a midnight snack! We made some great memories, rewarding ourselves with a gummy worm for every five pages we memorized for our tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your most memorable moment within your school career?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiking up to the "O" with friends on a summer night to watch the sunset. It was like a movie, and the lake looked magnificent.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I love that civil engineering, transportation engineering in particular, has a direct impact on people and communities...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech as my university for a variety of reasons. First, the fact that it is a technical institute and introduces students to their major courses relatively early on in their curriculum was a major draw for me. Also, I was impressed with Oregon Tech&amp;rsquo;s reputation and average hiring rates for students after graduation. I appreciated that the cost of attendance is lower compared to most universities despite the great higher education that it offers. Lastly, I liked the idea that Oregon Tech is close enough to home that I could visit family regularly, but am far enough away that I could be challenged living on my own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love that civil engineering, transportation engineering in particular, has a direct impact on people and communities. The people element is why I ultimately ended up studying my major and the reason I have stuck with it as well. I look forward to enhancing the quality of people&amp;rsquo;s lives through my career wherever I go.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job in your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the course of my major, I have come to genuinely love transportation engineering. It has so many facets in it of itself that are exciting and innovative. My dream job within transportation would be to design "Complete Streets" for the urban environment, which turns city streets into a place for all modes of transportation, whether a person is walking, biking, driving, or riding a bus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I get the chance to step aside from my studies, I really enjoy simply spending time with my family and friends. This has become increasingly challenging to do the further I have advanced in my major, especially as a graduate student.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your most memorable moment within your school career?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;While this memorable moment was not exactly in a classroom or on campus, earning my Engineer-in-Training (EIT) Certificate last year as a senior is something I will always remember. It is an honorable accomplishment. I could not have done it without the preparation and encouragement from the faculty in our department and having the certificate is highly beneficial for my career goals.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>Raised in Klamath Falls, I have experienced and witnessed the severe health disparities that are commonplace in our local communities. Population Health Management is an opportunity for us to understand and refurbish our communities...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Awards/Accomplishments at Oregon Tech:&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scholarships:&lt;/strong&gt; Orva Beard Scholarship Award, Tech Athletic Scholarship, Klamath County HS Scholarship, Jim Owens Presidential Scholarship, George Ferrell Memorial Scholarship&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Accomplishments:&lt;/strong&gt; 2-time Cascade Collegiate All-Conference Runner, 8th Place Team NAIA Cross Country Nationals, 2-Time Cascade Conference Runner of the Week&lt;/div&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech, originally, to study Biology-Health Sciences and compete on the cross country/track teams. After my first term, I decided to take advice from an incredibly inspirational lady I'd met in the community a year prior: to take Medical Sociology. That lady not only happened to be the professor of the class, but the director of Population Health Management program. After having shared a stimulating conversation long before, and taking her class a year later, I knew that Population Health Management was the degree I must pursue. It is with great luck that I could continue my love running while pursuing a degree that feeds my passion for improving health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The best part about Population Health Management is that it embraces the changes that are happening in the industry of healthcare. The Population Health Management curriculum is a reflection of the skills that are needed. We are, quite literally, filling in the gaps of what's needed and the first school in the country to be doing so. I enjoy nothing more than knowing that my classmates are as passionate about the future of healthcare as I am, and that we are all working to achieve something that hasn't been done before, together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job in your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because the field of population health management is new and developing, I believe that my dream job in the field has not been created yet. Part of our task as population health management students is to learn how to collaborate with health administrators, public health workers and other leaders (be it local, state, or federal) and to research the gaps in the healthcare field. After graduation, our task is to fill the void in the field. My dream job incorporates the skills I have learned in population health management program to accomplish filling this void.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Off-campus, I enjoy backpacking and hiking most. I am known for taking way too many sunset pictures, especially from the hills behind campus. I enjoy spending time with my family, reading, playing viola, going on walks (especially in the snow) and going on trail runs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your most memorable moment within your school career?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think the most memorable moment in my school career has been the opportunity to play in a band with some fellow students for the &lt;a href="/campus-life/student/programs/campus-activities-board/music-garden"&gt;Oregon Tech Music Festival&lt;/a&gt;. The opportunity arose when a teammate of mine asked if I'd be willing to play violin with them (I had played for nine years prior to Oregon Tech and had unfortunately reduced my playing upon starting college). The most memorable aspect was not only playing music again, although that was great, but in learning the various reasons these music-fanatics decided to attend Oregon Tech. We all shared passions for science and learning. Once I realized this, I realized that I couldn't imagine being anywhere but Oregon Tech.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What internships did you participate in during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am currently in an externship class with a handful of other students with the population health program. Our work requires that we work together all the time. In general, school has meant hours of study-time alone and independent research. However, in this externship program we practice the role of what our jobs will be like, and this requires constant collaboration and teamwork. As students, we often hear of the importance of people skills, but this externship puts to practice coordination beyond anything in the classroom. Coordination between the industry and community in healthcare will be as important as ever in the future of healthcare, and the experiences in the externship are already preparing us for the path ahead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have two more years before I graduate, but I can certainly see myself continuing education towards a Masters in Public Health, Masters in Medical Sociology, or to seek employment as a Population Health Coordinator for a hospital or public health department. I expect to work in the field in the short term, but certainly see myself gravitating back to teaching and/or higher education in the long term future.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>What I love most about my major are the hands-on aspects. I love getting out in the community and dealing with real-world problems...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Awards/Accomplishments at Oregon Tech:&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Dean's List: Fall, Winter, and Spring Terms 2015-2016 year&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Dean's List: Fall 2017&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;First Recipient of the Golden Own Scholarship&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Active Member of the Circle K Club&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Service Desk Coordinator for Housing and Residence Life&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Participated in the International Media Seminar in Paris, France (2016)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Tutored 1st graders at Mill's Elementary School (2015-2016)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I first learned about Oregon Tech from a college fair in 2010. I remember being very impressed by the student&amp;rsquo;s knowledge, excitement, clear presentation, and dedication as they talked about Oregon Tech. What attracted me the most about Oregon Tech was how much pride the students had in their work and how happy they were to be representing Oregon Tech. I knew from that day on that I wanted to be a part of the Oregon Tech family.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I love most about my major are the hands-on aspects. I love getting out in the community and dealing with real-world problems. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m making a difference and that Oregon Tech is cheering me on every step of the way. The professors in the PHM program go above and beyond to ensure their students succeed and are more than willing to contribute their time and energy to the dreams of every student they teach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job in your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job in this major would be to work as a patient advocate. I want to be out in the community working face-to-face with people in need to improve their quality of life. Next term I have an externship where I will be working with health professionals to educate the elderly on how to take better care of themselves in order to lessen emergency room visits and improve their overall care. I&amp;rsquo;m very excited for this opportunity and I hope to gain valuable experience in the field.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favorite things to do off campus are to visit the local shops, volunteer at the Klamath Falls Animal Shelter, and take paint classes at Wild Pigments Art Studio. I also enjoy attending performances at the Ross Ragland Theater and ice skating at the Running Y Resort.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your most memorable moment within your school career?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe the most memorable moment in my school career was getting the opportunity to conduct a plate waste study at Mill&amp;rsquo;s Elementary and present my team&amp;rsquo;s findings to community and school board members in an effort to improve children&amp;rsquo;s nutrition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What internships did you participate in during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently, I have not participated in any internships but I have one scheduled for Spring term and another scheduled in the Summer of 2017.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;After graduation, I plan to work in either a community health organization or for the State. In addition, I plan to continue my education and get a Master&amp;rsquo;s in Public Health, with an emphasis on health promotion, education, and community health improvement interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I am currently attending optometry school. After graduation, I plan to return to the rural west, to work in private practice...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="CallOut"&gt;Post-graduate program:&lt;/span&gt; Doctor of Optometry (O.D.) at the Southern College of Optometry (Memphis, TN)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="CallOut"&gt;O.D. graduation year:&lt;/span&gt; 2020&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you doing now, career-wise (or what do you plan to do after graduating)?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am currently attending optometry school- learning about the eyes, visual system, and the human body as a whole. After graduation, I plan to return to the rural west, to work in private practice. My goal as an optometric physician is to provide personalized primary eye care and specialize in ocular disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is one thing that you really appreciated about our program at Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The amazing professors and their commitment to real-world application is what sets OIT apart from the rest. All of my professors were so accomplished, yet so approachable and down to earth! The professors at OIT truly care about their students&amp;rsquo; success. I was never just handed facts to recite on a test. Instead, we participated in hands-on experiments, discussed current events, and analyzed research papers. These experiences taught me to think critically- a skill I will use throughout my entire career.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is one piece of advice that you would give to a student in our program today?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This program is rigorous and challenging, but don&amp;rsquo;t get so bogged down by school that you neglect to develop yourself as an individual, as well.  Make time to meet people, get involved in a school organization, get some job experience, find a hobby, invest in the community. Not only will graduate schools be looking for qualities that distinguish you from hundreds of other applicants, but these experiences will also give you a better sense of what you want out of life and your future career.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5&gt;Profile updated Feb 2017&lt;/h5&gt;</Biography>

After graduating I plan to stay in Oregon and practice Pharmacy. I have not completely decided if I am going to do a residency or not, but I am currently leaning towards Ambulatory Care Pharmacy, or Community Pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is one thing that you really appreciated about our program at Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed how involved all of my professors were. I remember studying in the lounge/hallway of DOW and my professors would stop and ask if I had any questions, sometimes even if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a class from them that term. All of my professors knew my name, and how I was doing in their class, and were very eager to offer any assistance if it were needed. I believe the small class sizes greatly attributed to the professor&amp;rsquo;s familiarity with all the students in their classes. In addition, the number of students in our specific major was also relatively small which made it very easy to form meaningful study groups!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is one piece of advice that you would give to a student in our program today?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Study as if you are committing the knowledge to your memory for forever, not just for the upcoming exam! Do not just cram for your exam, actively learn and study the material the courses give you, trust me it will come back to you later on in graduate or professional school. Additionally, this study habit will come in handy later on!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5&gt;Profile updated Feb 2017&lt;/h5&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>The Biology-Health Sciences program at Oregon Tech provided me with a fantastic education that has proven to be of great use in medical school...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="CallOut"&gt;Post-graduate program:&lt;/span&gt; Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO). Western University of Health Sciences, College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific-Northwest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="CallOut"&gt;D.O. graduation year:&lt;/span&gt; 2019&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you doing now, career-wise (or what do you plan to do after graduating)?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am currently in my 2nd year of medical school at Western U COMP-NW, where I am preparing to take my first set of licensing exams (COMLEX/USMLE). After those are completed in June, I will be moving up to Portland to begin my clinical rotations as a 3rd year medical student. Upon graduation, I would love to stay in the Pacific Northwest for residency in either Orthopedic Surgery or Pediatric Sports Medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is one thing that you really appreciated about our program at Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Biology-Health Sciences program at Oregon Tech provided me with a fantastic education that has proven to be of great use in medical school- primarily the emphasis of critical thinking and problem solving from the professors. Education aside, my favorite aspect of the program at Oregon Tech is the family-like environment. All of the professors have an open-door policy and are more than willing to sit down with students to talk through tough subjects or to simply give advice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What advice would you give to a student in our program today?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Enjoy the process. It&amp;rsquo;s a long journey to becoming a health professional and it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to take time for family, friends, and hobbies. Additionally, find a program that you&amp;rsquo;re passionate about and volunteer- don&amp;rsquo;t do things just because you think they will look good on a resume or application. Finally, don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to reach out to older students, alumni, and faculty about what are the necessary steps to applying to professional school. It can be an overwhelming process and having the guidance of someone who has been through the process is a huge reassurance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5&gt;Profile updated Mar 2017&lt;/h5&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I believe that everyone should take time to study abroad, and that those who don’t...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Studied Environmental Sciences at James Cook University in Townsville, Australia, July &amp;ndash; December 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you decided to study abroad?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;rsquo;t even thought about the possibility of studying abroad until my professor, Dr. Kerry Byrne, and I were talking about her study abroad experience in Costa Rica during a field day. She encouraged me to look into the options available through IE3 Global, where I found the perfect opportunity to study in the tropical rainforest of Northeastern Australia. James Cook University offered courses with field trips to study plants and animals in the wet and dry tropics, as well as in the Great Barrier Reef. In addition, I would have time after my studies to travel to Melbourne, Australia, where I could meet my father for the very first time. The timing was perfect, the opportunity was grand, and I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t let it pass me by.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What was the thing you struggled with the most?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the first few weeks, I met a ton of new people. I hung out on porches with students from Australia, China, England, Ireland, and Laos, joined my dorm&amp;rsquo;s sports team, and went dancing downtown, but hadn&amp;rsquo;t really made any actual friends yet. I spent my birthday alone in my dorm room, eating mashed potatoes on my bed, crying and wishing that I could be home with my friends and family during the beautiful Oregon summer months. I think that this dip in morale is something that happens to a lot of people who decide to travel so far away from home, but, as I learned, as long as you keep putting yourself out there, the loneliness is replaced by awesome experiences and long held memories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What was the most memorable thing about your experience?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I learned to say yes to every opportunity that presented itself to me. I said yes to a ten-day road trip with seven Norwegians whom I barely knew from a few of my classes, and it was the best decision I had made in my entire time abroad. We slept in huts in the rainforest and hostels in the cities, visited pubs and dance clubs, jumped off rocks at gigantic waterfalls, swam at the most beautiful beaches that I had ever seen (be sure to read the local signs so that you don&amp;rsquo;t spend 45 minutes in dangerous crocodile habitats), and created bonds that would last for the rest of our time in Australia and beyond.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Would you advise other students to study abroad?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe that everyone should take time to study abroad, and that those who don&amp;rsquo;t may look back one day and wish that they had. College is the ideal time for young people to take the leap. Most don&amp;rsquo;t have families to take care of or jobs that won&amp;rsquo;t allow them to travel for long periods of time. Students can continue their studies while also learning about other cultures, becoming self-reliant, and gaining a better understanding about themselves. Having this experience on a resume also shows employers that applicants are able to set and achieve goals, can be flexible in the face of unexpected situations, and can be successful in new surroundings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would you like us to know about you?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am a lifelong Oregonian with a love for nature, cooking, and dancing. I graduated from Oregon Tech with an honors degree in Environmental Sciences and tons of fantastic memories, including camping at Crater Lake for a week while catching butterflies for my Lepidoptera summer course, creating friendships with a ton of people as a Resident Advisor in the Castle and the Village, and sharing in the suffering that was Organic Chemistry and Physics (although very valuable courses) with some of my closest friends. I am now working as an event coordinator for a company that plans sustainability conferences all over the United States, where I am helping to spread sustainability best practices to those who will implement and spread them even further across the world.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>Going abroad is a great way to get integrated in a community and to really experience different cultures...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you decide to study abroad?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I had always wanted to go to Japan, and I was thinking about working there someday. Going abroad is a great way to visit a new country and my trip was a good test run to see if living in Japan was the right choice for me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What was the thing you struggled with the most?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think the language barrier was the hardest part of my trip. I had studied Japanese for a few years in high school but it had been a while sense I had practiced. Next time I go I want to make sure that I am more proficient in the language.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What was the most memorable thing about your experience?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My entire trip was memorable. I was able to do a lot of things and I had an amazing time with my host family.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Would you advise other students to study abroad?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes. If there is somewhere you have always wanted to visit or see, going abroad is a great way to get integrated in a&amp;nbsp;community&amp;nbsp;and to really experience different cultures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would you like us to know about you?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I enjoy working on 3D puzzles and Sudoku. I am an Electrical Engineering major, hoping to one day work with Disney and create interactive and educational games for children and adults.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>The most memorable part of my experience was participating in site visits in Ireland...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you decide to study abroad?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before study abroad, I had never broken my comfort zone so completely, so in large part it was an exercise in discipline and self-exploration. Also, I would be able to fit the course work into my own course schedule, so I would be able to graduate on time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What was the thing you struggled with the most?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a word, my greatest struggle was balance. My priorities were constantly in competition with each other, and I had difficulty picking what I really wanted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wanted to see the world. I wanted to be a great student. I wanted to meet people. Mostly, I wanted a genuine experience, which is often less romantic than &amp;ldquo;study abroad&amp;rdquo; is thought to be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Irish students all viewed the &amp;ldquo;study abroad&amp;rdquo; students as kids on a holiday. There were students who took easy classes and visited new countries every weekend, while I studied because I wanted to do well in classes, and earn the respect of my Irish peers. I also wanted to have a local experience, so I spent time at local restaurants and at dinners with my roommates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Ireland, all the engineering students take more focused class work, and so by their third year (I studied abroad in my third year), they are doing their capstone project. I still had not taken the bulk of my specialized classes, but I had taken a wider set of introductory classes, so there were days I was ahead of the curriculum, and days I was very far behind. We were given a week off to study for finals, so I finally traveled to Rome, and then got sick for the entire week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What was the most memorable thing about your experience?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most memorable part of my experience was participating in site visits in Ireland. I did so independently at the Aran Island harbor, alongside actual practicing professionals in the country, as well as on a trip with my classmates to see the structural retrofit of a church that had experienced a terrible fire. Having gone on field visits in America, seeing similarities and differences between design and implementation in the different countries was affirming. Also, being able to meet with practicing and aspiring professionals abroad is something that I believe will echo with me throughout my career.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also fondly remember staying up late in the architecture studio (where the upper class engineering students were given a work space) with a Canadian student who felt just as out of place as I did. It was the peak of the challenge I sought out when I chose the program. The civil engineering students liked to boast that University of Limerick&amp;rsquo;s civil program was the toughest in the country, and I was proud to work alongside them. Their work was much more hand-drafting and hand-calculation driven. There were fewer tests, less homework, and almost exclusively independent study and one project work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Would you advise other students to study abroad?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The short answer is yes. I would advise any student with the inkling for a study abroad experience to pick up the phone and make a call or send an email to apply for a program to see if it could be financially feasible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a word, I have to say there is resonant value in having global exposure. New perspective can revolutionize how you think, or affirm the way you already do. In engineering, specifically, having exposure to international design standards can be helpful in further informing the kind of conservatism you face in your own career.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would you like us to know about you?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am a firm believer in integrated design, and presence of ARTS education in STEM fields. I am currently employed in site development work, and while I begin preparation for my professional licensure exams, I professionally aspire to keep environmentally-conscious design a viable, economic, and sustainable decision for developers in the Northwest.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>All of the professors in my department are super helpful and want us to succeed. They are always willing to help...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; I chose Oregon Tech originally because I want to pursue a degree in Nursing. I shortly found out that that career was not meant for me. The school was close enough to home for me to be able to visit, but far enough that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to go all the time. The price was also a factor and I had heard nothing but good things about this school.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of the professors in my department are super helpful and want us to succeed. They are always willing to help; all you have to do is ask.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job in your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Becoming a Physical Therapist. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What's your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I enjoy hiking and going rock climbing at The Ledge. I also enjoy going to the sporting events for the Oregon Tech athletic teams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What's your most memorable moment within your school career?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taking Medical Microbiology with Burt Clark. He is an amazing professor and isn&amp;rsquo;t afraid to goof off to get you to remember information. The class is hard but he makes it super enjoyable and fun. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What internships did you participate in during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have not participated in any internships, but I have shadowed at a few different physical therapy clinics around town and it has solidified my love for physical therapy and made me beyond excited for graduate school.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>Oregon Tech is close to the community that it creates; it’s small. Small enough that my classmates are also my friends...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coming from a small high school I already knew the value in being part of something close to its own populace. Oregon Tech is close to the community that it creates; it&amp;rsquo;s small. Small enough that my classmates are also my friends, and when I talk to my professors they know my name.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My major, Biology Health-Sciences, allows me to have opportunities like extracurricular research. These opportunities let me develop my mind in an interesting way that is outside of the structure of required classes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job in your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;These four years here at Oregon Tech are not my last. I am dreaming and aspiring to medical school, and a position as a Doctor of Osteopathy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What's your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Volunteer. Here in Klamath Falls there is not as much off campus. Not until you get involved with the community and get to know Klamath Falls for the potential of rich experiences that it is. I believe that volunteering is the best way to do this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What's your most memorable moment within your school career?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My most memorable moment of my school career is less of a moment and more of a continuation of moments. Since winter term of my sophomore year, I got involved in an independent research course. Every week I&amp;rsquo;ve been challenged with failed experiments that have led to discovery. The feeling I get from being one of the first to learn something new, no matter how big or small, is a really rewarding feeling. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Post-graduation I will be applying for medical school. My ideal choice is the D.O. school in Lebanon, OR. I am looking forward to the schooling; learning about medicine on a more profound level.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>One of the many memorable experiences that I had at Oregon Tech was traveling to Paris to participate in an international media seminar as part of a communication course...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h4&gt;Awards/Accomplishments:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Research paper &amp;ldquo;The Influences of Music on Recall Ability&amp;rdquo; was accepted into the Northwest Communication Association (NWCA) in 2016&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Also presented at the 2016 NWCA conference on a panel titled &amp;ldquo;Transcending Disciplinary Boundaries: Bridging Perspectives on Musical Discourse&amp;rdquo; with three professors from Oregon Tech&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Certification in Negotiation and Conflict Resolution&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Made the President&amp;rsquo;s list seven out of eight terms at Oregon Tech and the Dean&amp;rsquo;s list the remaining term&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech because of the small class sizes, the broad range of experience demonstrated by the communication professors, and also in part because my best friend was applying with me to attend Oregon Tech. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The thing I enjoy most about the communication major is that it molds to the needs of student aspirations. It has a broad range of application in the real world while it simultaneously hones in on very specific skills. A communication major at Oregon Tech provides not only practical skills and knowledge, but it also provides students with an ability to think and articulate critical thinking, adapt to unfamiliar contexts, and utilize effective communication through a host of avenues.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job in your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job is becoming a foreign services officer in United States embassies overseas and is the career that I am actively pursuing upon graduation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What's your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have many hobbies &amp;ndash; some of which include being in ultimate Frisbee and flag football leagues, playing music for weddings, and being outdoors with my German Shepherd. My primary hobby is playing the cello and guitar in my down time as well as being on a worship team at my church. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What's your most memorable moment within your school career?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the many memorable experiences that I had at Oregon Tech was traveling to Paris to participate in an international media seminar as part of a communication course. Other memorable moments would be conducting and then presenting my research project to the NWCA conference in Coeur d&amp;rsquo;Alene, Idaho and also participating in a panel at the conference with three other professors from Oregon Tech. I also earned my NAUI scuba certification after successful completion of a scuba training course at Oregon Tech. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I aspire to become a foreign services officer in United States embassies overseas. I have a passion for traveling and experiencing new cultures. I believe that the communications major at Oregon Tech has more than adequately prepared me to undertake my ambitious career choice.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I really felt like the Health Sciences program did a fantastic job of preparing me for medical school...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="CallOut"&gt;Post-graduate program:&lt;/span&gt; School of Medicine at the Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="CallOut"&gt;M.D. graduation year:&lt;/span&gt; 2019&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you doing now, career-wise (or what do you plan to do after graduating)?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am a medical student at the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, Oregon. Currently (May 2017), I am in my clinical rotations and doing pancreatic cancer research as a part of my scholarly project. I am also currently a second lieutenant in the United States Air Force as a part of the Health Professions Scholarship Program. I plan on specializing in general surgery and after residency will serve in the Air Force for four years. Upon completion of my service commitment I plan to practice general surgery in a rural area, hopefully even in my hometown of Klamath Falls.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is one thing that you really appreciated about our program at Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really felt like the Health Sciences program did a fantastic job of preparing me for medical school. There was hardly anything we learned about in medical school that wasn&amp;rsquo;t at least touched on by the courses taught at Oregon Tech. Oregon Tech&amp;rsquo;s anatomy class helped make anatomy in medical school fun and not the onerous struggle it was for others. It was really great to have cadaver exposure before medical school as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The faculty at Oregon Tech was invaluable. They really make an effort to get to know each student and help us realize our potential as students and pre-health professionals. The small class sizes at Oregon Tech help facilitate active learning of material and often during class and labs students get one on one time with instructors that helps them strengthen their weak areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What advice would you give to a student in our program today?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;While you are taking classes at Oregon Tech really try and learn the information they are teaching. Don&amp;rsquo;t just cram for a test, do whatever you need to so that most of the information sinks in. The things being taught come up over and over again and learning it right the first time will really help in the long run.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, don&amp;rsquo;t be in too much of a rush to get onto the next stage. Each step of the process to becoming a physician, dentist, pharmacist, etc. is significant and it&amp;rsquo;s so important to see the value in what you are doing. There are always opportunities to make a difference in the lives around you whether you are an undergraduate student, medical student, or even a physician.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5&gt;Profile updated May 2017&lt;/h5&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>With the availability of the Electrical Engineering dual major program, I knew that Oregon Tech would set me up for success in both the industry and graduate school...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oregon Tech has the only ABET accredited Renewable Energy Engineering undergraduate program in the country. With the availability of the Electrical Engineering dual major program, I knew that Oregon Tech would set me up for success in both the industry and graduate school, depending on the path I would eventually choose upon graduation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love the versatility of majoring in both Electrical Engineering (EE) and Renewable Energy Engineering (REE). The EE degree is the more traditional, focused, and specialized degree while the REE degree is broader and extends into multiple disciplines of engineering. I believe the marriage of these degrees gives me an advantage over other new graduates as I have a wider perspective and better understanding of different disciplines and how they interact.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job in your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job would be to take my engineering degrees and apply them to in-space experiments as an astronaut, specifically with space-based solar applications. The photovoltaic technologies are already integral in near-earth and deep space spacecraft and will continue to be important. Someday, I hope to contribute to efforts of harvesting power from satellites with solar panels that wirelessly transmit the power down to the earth&amp;rsquo;s surface for general purpose use in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What's your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favorite activities off campus include getting involved in the Klamath Falls community. In 2014, I decided to serve the state of Oregon by joining the Air National Guard at the 173d Fighter Wing here in town. In addition to my guard commitment, I have had the opportunity of volunteering at the local animal shelter, helping out at youth sporting events, serving food to the less fortunate, and more. Being a small town and tight knit community, I enjoy supporting the community that supports us as students.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What's your most memorable moment within your school career?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://oregontechsfstatic.azureedge.net/sitefinity-production/images/default-source/news-images/krista-instagram.png?sfvrsn=910d9c60_0" displaymode="Original" alt="Krista Instagram" title="Krista Instagram" style="float: left; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-right: 15px;" /&gt;My most memorable moment would be when I got a five-stage bipolar junction transistor amplifier to work in the lab after about ten hours of design, build, and troubleshooting of the issues that arose within this circuit. The circuit used about 50 components once complete. Getting it to work was exciting in itself, but it also provided me the opportunity to look back and see how far I&amp;rsquo;ve come in five short years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What internships did you participate in during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last summer, I was able to work as a Research Associate in the 2016 NASA Propulsion Academy at Marshall Space Flight Center. As a kid, I dreamed of designing rockets for NASA. There is no way to express the value of the experience I gained from working among some of the nation&amp;rsquo;s finest solid rocket propulsion scientists in the world. From research skills to raw knowledge I picked up from subject matter experts, my experience was invaluable. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;After considering a handful of offers, I have decided to accept a position with Northrop Grumman in Redondo Beach, CA working on Electronics and Payloads in their Aerospace Systems Sector. I am extremely appreciative of the opportunities Oregon Tech has provided me and look forward to this next step in my career!&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>The Biology-Health Sciences program was an obvious choice for me!</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose this major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Twelve years ago, I went to the morgue for the first time and found my passion in life. I want to perform autopsies as a Pathologist Assistant, and one of the first steps was to get my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s in a science field. The Biology-Health Sciences program was an obvious choice for me!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How are you planning to use your degree in the future?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I want to help families and friends process and gain closure with their loved one&amp;rsquo;s passing. Performing autopsies is a delicate task in which I have to handle the aspect of death as well as show respect for the deceased. I also want to be able to bring in my Army and Mortuary Affairs experience into this field. I just applied to a master&amp;rsquo;s program to become a Pathologist Assistant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you decide to join &lt;a href="/academics/ssc/tech-opportunities-program"&gt;TOP&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I decided to join TOP to get help with study skills and to get another form of support with my education at Oregon Tech. Prior to joining TOP, I felt like I did not belong in college and became discouraged at a rapid pace. Being a non-traditional student with four hundred things on my plate, it is always beneficial to have people to help me keep going when things got tough. TOP provided me with a huge support through my journey in college!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish more veterans knew that there is more support on campus than they think. It is hard being a veteran and going to school as a civilian after all of the things we had to deal with in the military. School almost seems insignificant sometimes. The Student Veterans Program, Veterans Action Committee, counselors in the Student Health Center, and many more people dedicate their time to our student veterans. The next step is for veterans to use the services that are free to them!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is your favorite hobby, and do you have any experiences you would like to share regarding that hobby?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have several hobbies, but the main two are reading and crocheting. Reading is my escape from the stress of the real world. Crocheting is a way to feel proud about something I have hand-created, and it is a way to make some really awesome gifts!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What fuels you to succeed?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My family and my fortitude. My husband, son, mom, dad, and sisters have been there to help me through my long journey through college. Without my fortitude, I would have given up after the first poor grade I received. Although I did not have the easiest time through college, I know what I want and what I need to do to get to my end goal. I refuse to give up on my dream no matter how many hurdles I am faced with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Who is your favorite professor and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favorite professor at Oregon Tech is Dr. O&amp;rsquo;Shaughnessy. She has been so supportive since I met her my first term at Oregon Tech. She saw my passion for this field when I was in the cadaver lab, and she has always supported my dream.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>With this degree, I plan on getting out in the community and helping the local food bank reach as many people as possible to help with the crisis...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose this program (major)?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose this major because I love being out in the community and finding new ways to help.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing in this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this particular field, I am passionate about helping solve the food insecurity problems in Klamath Falls.  With this degree, I plan on getting out in the community and helping the local food bank reach as many people as possible to help with the crisis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you decide to join &lt;a href="/academics/ssc/tech-opportunities-program"&gt;TOP&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I decided to join TOP because I am a single mom of four children and really need all the support I can get.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish students knew how helpful faculty and staff members are. They genuinely care about their students and will bend over backwards to help.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is your favorite hobby, and do you have any experiences you would like to share regarding that hobby?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favorite hobby is spending time with horses.  I have been around horses since I was two, and it is one of my passions.  People do not really understand how sensitive horses are to people&amp;rsquo;s emotions.  I love going out to the barn even if I am just there to feed.  The smell of my horse as well as running my hands down her neck relieves of all my stress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What fuels you to succeed?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My children fuel me to succeed.  I want to show them that anyone can succeed if they just apply themselves. I want them to know there is always a way to overcome obstacles and succeed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Who is your favorite professor and why? Do you know any interesting facts about that particular professor?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favorite professor is Stephanie Machado.  She has been there for me every step of the way through this program. If I had questions, all I had to do was ask. I think she has gone above and beyond her scope to help out her students.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>From the moment Operations Management was declared as my major, I never doubted my decision...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose this program (major)?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Serendipity&lt;/em&gt;. I left high school knowing one thing:  I was destined for a career in STEM. I loved math and the scientific process.  When it came to transfer my junior college credits to a university, life constraints gave me two choices.  Oregon Tech won purely from the logistical equation of attending any 4-year school in Oregon.  From there, I considered one of Oregon Tech&amp;rsquo;s most capable majors, civil engineering.  Only after heading in that direction, did I stumble across Operations Management. I interviewed professionals from both the Civil and Operations Management Departments.  The interviews confirmed my hunch &amp;ndash; I was meant for a career in Operations Management.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing in this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My degree is all about change, &amp;lsquo;Continuous improvement,&amp;rsquo; to be specific. It would be preposterous for anyone who embraces positive change not to look internally at the tools and methods used in their industry. We &amp;lsquo;operations folk&amp;rsquo; detest inefficiencies in any capacity. In my future, time will naturally be spent in varying combinations of investigating and applying improvement initiatives both internally and externally. One day, I will be streamlining a supply chain &amp;ndash; the next I will be designing a better broom to sweep the warehouse. This degree fits me so well that to be told not to initiate change would wither my soul.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you decide to join &lt;a href="/academics/ssc/tech-opportunities-program"&gt;TOP&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;TOP is an instant support system and is the best insurance policy a student can opt-into to set themselves up for success. I wanted to be part of TOP because of the community of dedicated individuals who happen to have access to a wide range of resources. I knew if I could be a part of TOP, I would have everything I needed to finish my path to graduation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our return on investment is ridiculous! And because this is a small teaching institute, students have access to extended time with experts from industry. We may not have a large Greek society, plentiful dining options, or access to great shopping &amp;ndash; but Oregon Tech offers us an immersive, application-based, data-driven experience unlike so many other educational institutions. In the end, the lack of distraction only adds to the quality of our education.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is your favorite hobby, and do you have any experiences you would like to share regarding that hobby?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clich&amp;eacute; or not, I love to learn.  I devour podcasts, TED talks, audible non-fiction, articles, and scientific studies. I end up learning a lot of interesting, but ultimately useless information.  Sometimes, however, the things that I stumble upon are important or applicable enough to act on.  TOP has allowed me to do this with great support.  Recognizing that we lacked time and space to improve our negotiation skills in preparing for our first job offer, TOP and I worked together to sponsor Oregon Tech&amp;rsquo;s first compensation package negotiation workshop open to all students.  We grow our collective strength when we are afforded the opportunity and support to pursue initiatives from our innate intuition and educationally based acumen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What fuels you to succeed?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My DNA.  While at TOP, I was guided through the Myers Briggs Type Indicator assessment and discovered that I am an ENTJ.  According to Truity, my Myers Briggs type is one of the least common types in the population and the rarest type among women.  As an ENTJ, we make up only 3% of the population.  Of all women, only 1% are ENTJs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before the understanding that came with the Myers Briggs assessment, I considered and rationalized many possible contributing factors fueling me to succeed.  Because of the rarity of my personality, it made sense that I would yet to find evidence to suggest that my drive was anything other than the expression of outside influences.  The more I learned about my personality, however, the more it became clear.  My drive and ambition are simply part of my natural makeup.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Who is your favorite professor and why? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Terri Torres.  I admire Professor Torres&amp;rsquo;s straight line approach and pragmatic cultural awareness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As someone who values efficiency, her lectures are irreplaceable.  Torres&amp;rsquo;s pace of teaching is faster than any other I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced at Oregon Tech.  When I took Statistics II with her, I felt as though I finally had a professor willing to dish it out at a pace that gave me the most value per lecture minute.  For those of us that soak up material at a quicker pace, this firehose stream of information is refreshing!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As someone who is naturally curious, the extra insights into population statistics used in lecture examples were fascinating &amp;ndash; and felt very much like a treat along the way.  Torres encouraged us to think critically about our findings and often asked us to confront uncomfortable truths.  It is not enough to understand why something is (although statistics is a great tool at describing these states) &amp;ndash; but Torres pushed us to contemplate how we would approach change.  It was never a question that we should use our education to better the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I chose Oregon Tech because I was drawn to the focus on hands-on learning...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose this program (major)?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech because I was drawn to the hands-on learning environment. I spent almost equal amounts of time in lecture and lab during the average week. I feel like this approach to learning provides many useful skills. Oregon Tech also has a great return on investment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How are you planning to use your degree in the future?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hope to contribute to finding new materials for electronics that are more efficient and allow for devices that are more powerful. I have always been fascinated by electronics, and I am very excited to finally start doing research in this field. I am starting my career as a Radiation Characterization Research Engineer with the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) in Albuquerque, NM this summer. I will be pursuing my Master&amp;rsquo;s and Ph.D. while working as a research engineer for the AFRL.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you decide to join &lt;a href="/academics/ssc/tech-opportunities-program"&gt;TOP&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was looking for a resource that would help me navigate the difficulties of college. I am the first person in my family to attend a four-year university as a full-time student. Since I was a first-generation student, I did not have much help in making it over common hurdles. TOP has helped me overcome many obstacles and provided support in stressful times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think Oregon Tech is a bit of a hidden gem as far as Oregon colleges are concerned. OIT provides graduates with great hands-on education, which allows them to be more knowledgeable than many college graduates with similar degrees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is your favorite hobby, and do you have any experiences you would like to share regarding that hobby?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am a big fan of mountain biking, and I enjoy riding as much as possible. I think Klamath Falls is a quickly growing biking community, which is awesome. There are many great trails in Moore Park and Spence Mountain, which provide amazing views and are a ton of fun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What fuels you to succeed?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have an insatiable curiosity and a desire to be successful. I always want to know how stuff works, and this pushes me to always be learning. I also want to be successful and lead a full and happy life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Who is your favorite professor and why? Do you know any interesting facts about that particular professor?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Professor Eve Klopf is an incredible lab teacher who goes out of her way to help students solve problems. She is particularly passionate about wireless communications, which is showcased in her ARK radio club and the classes she teaches.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I have been interested in dental hygiene since grade school...As I increasingly learned about dental hygiene, I knew it was the perfect career for me.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose this program (major)?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been interested in dental hygiene since grade school. My cousin became a dental hygienist when I was in high school, and I job shadowed her for my senior project. As I increasingly learned about dental hygiene, I knew it was the perfect career for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How are you planning to use your degree in the future?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in the dental hygiene program I was required to take a community health course, which was three terms long. My community health project, along with three other classmates, was to meet the dental needs of the migrant population in Klamath County. We focused on the migrant population in Merrill, Bonanza, and Malin. I was touched by how much this population needed assistance. However, it was not easy for them since finances and transportation were a barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After analyzing our entire project, I want to keep helping and reaching out to those who cannot obtain the care they need. Therefore, I plan to use my degree in the future by working for a public health family practice. Public health practices receive visits from many Oregon Health Plan patients. Public health practices also reach out to the community and provide a &amp;ldquo;free dental day&amp;rdquo; once a year. I want to reach out to those who need a helping hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why did you decide to join &lt;a href="/academics/ssc/tech-opportunities-program"&gt;TOP&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was accepted into the Dental Hygiene program in 2014, I was struggling with the many intense classes I was in. I reached out to my dental hygiene advisor about how I could possibly become more focused and less stressed. She gave me some helpful tips and also suggested I reach out to TOP. I was not aware of the TOP program, but I decided to consider it and finally applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is your favorite hobby, and do you have any experiences you would like to share regarding that hobby?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have many hobbies. Some of them include crafting, hiking, and traveling. One of my favorite is hiking. Last summer, my boyfriend and I visited 10 waterfalls in Oregon in just two days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What fuels you to succeed? &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents. They both migrated to the United States about 26 years ago from Mexico to give me and my siblings a better life. They are the reason I am here following my dreams. They not only support me but also make me want to push harder and achieve my goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who is your favorite professor and why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeannie Bopp in the dental hygiene department. She first became an adjunct instructor when I was a junior. Shortly after, she advanced to the senior clinic lead instructor. She was not only very helpful in clinic when seeing patients, but also in our seminar classes.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I always knew I wanted to be an engineer of some variety...I truly enjoy creating applications that enable others to solve difficult problems.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose this program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I always knew I wanted to be an engineer of some variety. My first thought was to become a bio-medical engineer and help design functional prosthetics. However, I quickly realized that the sight of blood makes me uncomfortable, which meant that my dreams of attaching prosthetics was probably not a good plan for me. At that point, I thought the next best way to help people would be to develop software that assisted them in some way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing in this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am passionate about creating applications that enable people to solve difficult problems, which I may not even know exist. I come from a background that allows me the privilege of being unaware of certain problems, but I want to make sure people who face challenges have the tools they need to overcome the challenges and to solve the problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you decide to join &lt;a href="/academics/ssc/tech-opportunities-program"&gt;TOP&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of my friends who was in TRIO in high school suggested I apply to a TRIO program in college. After some research, I thought that as a first-generation college student having an additional support system was a good idea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish everyone knew how amazing all of the Computer Software Engineering staff are! All of the professors have been amazing and very helpful. Some went as far as having study parties for students at their houses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is your favorite hobby, and do you have any experiences you would like to share regarding that hobby?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am an avid &amp;lsquo;crocheter.&amp;rsquo; When I started learning how to crochet my mom had been already trying to crochet for a while. She spent a weekend trying to teach herself but was so frustrated. On the other hand, my dad grabbed the yarn and the hook and started crocheting right away. When my mom asked him why he did not tell her he knew how to crochet, he just shrugged and said, &amp;lsquo;Well, you didn&amp;rsquo;t ask.&amp;rsquo; So, I learned how to crochet from my dad.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What fuels you to succeed?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really want to pay at least one month of my parents&amp;rsquo; mortgage while still paying all my own bills. My parents have been an amazing driving force for me, and they have been doing absolutely everything they could to make sure I could go to college.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Who is your favorite professor and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a tie between Todd Breedlove and Phil Howard. They are both so amazing and supportive, and they always made sure I fully understood the material and could ask any question.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I plan to use my degree to make myself a better person as an engineer and to help make the world a better place...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose this major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was previously a machinist when a professor from Oregon Tech encouraged me to pursue an engineering degree. He showed me what it means to be an engineer. I was really intrigued by it and thought that engineering might be more interesting than machining. Engineering also comes with a bigger paycheck.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing in this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have become passionate about making any kind of a product faster and cheaper than anyone else can. I would like to use my degree to simplify life for everyone. We often hear people say, &amp;ldquo;It is not possible to do that&amp;rdquo; or &amp;rdquo;It is not cost effective or efficient.&amp;rdquo; Well, I believe anything is possible if we put our minds to it and say, &amp;ldquo;Yes I can.&amp;rdquo; Therefore, if I can use my degree to make myself a better person as an engineer and help the world, while keeping the consideration of our planet in mind, I will have achieved my goals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you decide to join &lt;a href="/academics/ssc/tech-opportunities-program"&gt;TOP&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two friends of mine spoke to me about the benefits offered by the TRIO program. I thought that having other people available to help with homework would be helpful. Cultural trips provided by TOP&amp;nbsp;were also be a great way to release stress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oregon Tech&amp;rsquo;s reputation should be advertised in more ways. Companies must know more about us when considering their hiring processes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is your favorite hobby, and do you have any experiences you would like to share regarding that hobby?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favorite hobby I carried for years was the drum corps. I used to play the trumpet and soprano bugle later in life. For several years, I was a soloist and participated in many championships.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What fuels you to succeed?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;After being a machinist for many years, I realize that our world and technology are always changing. Someday, manual labor jobs will not exist. There might be some people living on the welfare system due to their lack of a higher education. I want to carry myself much higher than that. The only way I can advance myself is through education.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Who is your favorite professor and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have had many awesome professors. Every one of them gave me the necessary tools to get where I am now. Although I find it difficult to name just one, I will say that Dr. Waterman has helped most. He has always been there for me. Without Dr. Waterman, I would not be able to continue living in Klamath Falls and finish this degree.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose this program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Growing up, my dream job was to produce commercials for sports companies like Nike. I was always moved by how they were able to invoke emotions in a two-minute video.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From seeing those videos, I knew that I wanted to be a part of something that "moved" or "inspired" people, which led me to marketing. Another reason I was drawn to marketing is because I love the concept of expressing myself to the world. I feel that everyone has a unique story to tell and helping a company establish their awareness in the market is something that is very rewarding to me. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I wish to change in the marketing industry is helping organizations stay authentic to their culture and not be persuaded to change their brand equity simply because of new trends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I feel that many companies are looking to jump on the nearest bandwagon to expand their market instead of staying consistent with their distinctive advantage. A key concept of marketing is that you do not want to go searching for your customers; you want them to come to you. Therefore, I want to use my knowledge to guide companies in that direction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also want to help small businesses make their mark in the industry again. I feel that the backbone to any business is marketing. After all, a company can have the most amazing product in the world, but if they do not establish the awareness of that product then it is useless. Helping a small business establish its awareness and clientele is something very appealing to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish that everyone was more aware of the &lt;a href="/campus-life/student/programs/outdoor-program"&gt;Outdoor Program&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that our Klamath Falls campus offers. If you wanted to camp, hike, fish, and even snowboard with your classmates, the outdoor program offers tremendous deals and transportation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is your greatest achievement, and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My greatest achievement is that I have been a successful student athlete for my entire college career. I feel that being a student-athlete is commonly overlooked by employers. As an athlete, we have a lot of experience in time management, dealing with adversity, and we also have a competitive edge in everything we do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is your favorite hobby, and do you have any experiences you would like to share regarding that hobby?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My current favorite hobby is photography, and I think it is because I am so passionate about marketing. I perceive marketing as expressing some sort of feeling or message as simply as possible, and photography is just that. You are literally trying to capture a picture that is worth a thousand words. I have also learned a lot about marketing from photography. Photography has given me insight to how others view a picture and what they are self-consciously drawn to. Little things such as the rule of thirds or using cropping to focus on the main subject are very important in understanding how the viewer interprets the picture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What fuels you to succeed?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;What fuels me to succeed is knowing that attending college is an investment in myself. Therefore, I want to get my money&amp;rsquo;s worth and learn the most I can. Also, I feel that the more I learn, the more of an asset I will be. I feel that what makes me successful at Oregon Tech is our amazing teaching staff. They are so personable and really great at teaching in a variety of ways so that everyone understands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Who is your favorite professor and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favorite professor is Kristy Wideman. Kristy is tremendous at pushing her students to their limits so they see their overall potential and make sure they are getting every dollar&amp;rsquo;s worth of their education. She often has us do hands-on activities with local businesses in town, which not only looks good on a resume, but also gives us real life experience. She is also one of many professors in the Management Department who are truly invested in their students and does everything she can to make sure they succeed.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>Once I started at Oregon Tech, I quickly became involved in student clubs such as the Association of Energy Engineer Club...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose this program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My older brother, whom I look up to, studied engineering at OSU, and he is the one who encouraged me to look into electrical engineering. In addition, during my senior year of high school, I was fortunate to shadow an electrical engineer at a former electric motorcycle company called Brammo. I felt inspired by the high-tech projects that the company was developing, and so I decided to pursue electrical engineering.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am really drawn to the high-tech world and would like to work for a company that innovates, develops new technologies, and is able to think outside the box. I recently interviewed with Black &amp;amp; Veatch, and given their motto of &amp;ldquo;building a world of difference&amp;rdquo;, I felt that it would be a perfect fit. Although I was not chosen for the position, I gained interview experience as well as an insight into what I could be doing in the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you decide to join &lt;a href="/academics/ssc/tech-opportunities-program"&gt;TOP&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I decided to join TOP&amp;nbsp;for the extra advising. Joining this program allowed me to meet many great students and work with some amazing people. I believe that my college experience would not have been the same had I not joined TOP. Even to this day, I appreciate all of the friendships and mentorship I gained from this program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish incoming students knew about the &lt;a href="/academics/ssc/peer-consulting-services"&gt;Peer Consulting Center&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and its hours. It is a great resource from day one, especially at Oregon Tech where you start taking major classes in your first year. Also, I really like the small school atmosphere where everyone is friendly and approachable. Once I started at Oregon Tech, I quickly became involved in student clubs such as the Association of Energy Engineer Club. It was one of the best decisions I have made as it helped me connect with upper classmen in my program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is your favorite hobby, and do you have any experiences you would like to share regarding that hobby?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love cycling, especially out on the road whether it is raining or sunny. It is my goal to do a century ride (100 miles) someday in the near future. Cycling keeps me happy and healthy, and it is something that I will continue to do for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What fuels you to succeed? What makes you so successful at Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking ahead and seeing all of the interesting things I can do with my degree motivates me to get up every day and work hard. I hope to create a successful career for myself so that I can fully support my family.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Who is your favorite professor and why? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really like Mehmet Vurkac who is able to explain complex problems in a very accessible and clear way. I have learned so much from him!&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I appreciate the high return on investment offered by Oregon Tech’s degree, the small class sizes, and the high quality of the education...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose this program (major)?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have always liked science. When I was growing up, some of the first texts I read were my mom&amp;rsquo;s medical books full of charts, graphs, pictures and numbers. I also really like animals and thought the Biology-Health Sciences major would give me a strong foundation to pursue careers in medicine, medical research or animal science.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At first, I did not fully believe I was ready for such a rigorous program, but Dr. O&amp;rsquo;Shaughnessy talked me into giving it a shot and assured me that I have the aptitude to complete this degree. If it were not for her, I would not have graduated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How are you planning to use your degree in the future?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would like to do research. Specifically, I am interested in cancer and drug development research. I am also interested in animal research, which may sound off-putting to some people, but I believe it could be very valuable. I love animals, and as a researcher I feel that I will be able to always advocate for the highest standard of care and respect for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you decide to join &lt;a href="/academics/ssc/tech-opportunities-program"&gt;TOP&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a non-traditional student, I was looking for additional guidance in accessing campus resources, applying for scholarships, and other opportunities. Also, having one more group on campus pulling for me has been invaluable. It helped me stay focused and not give up in times of doubt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish I had known about the altitude of Klamath Falls before I came here. On a more serious note, I appreciate the high return on investment offered by Oregon Tech&amp;rsquo;s degree, the small class sizes, and the high quality of the education I received.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is your favorite hobby, and do you have any experiences you would like to share regarding that hobby?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favorite hobby is animal husbandry. I currently focus on breeding and showing rabbits, but in the past, I also trained dogs and bred other animals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What fuels you to succeed?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am fully aware that I am my children&amp;rsquo;s best resource at living good lives and having a positive future. I have been working very hard, but sometimes I have my moments of doubt and feel like giving up. However, I know that there is no real giving up. My family needs me, and I know that I will do everything I can to care and provide for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Who is your favorite professor and why? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favorite professor is Dr. O&amp;rsquo;Shaughnessy. She has done nothing but have faith in me from the very beginning. She heard me cry and doubt myself; she was there to witness and celebrate my successes; she always supported me, and she always gave me an opportunity to redeem myself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also really appreciate Dr. Clark. He is inspirational, funny, gifted, but also kind, honest and very supportive of his students. I know that he knows my name, but I am not sure he knows how much I appreciate his impact on my life.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I feel confident that I made the right choice and that I will be very happy with my career...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose this program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I learned about the Respiratory Care Program (RCP) after applying to a medical imaging program. I was hesitant to switch my major as I did not know much about the field of respiratory care. Respiratory therapists treat all kinds of patients from healthy to critically ill. Since I wanted a predictable job where I knew what would happen day to day, I knew RCP would challenge every part of me. I had my second thoughts, until I learned about cardiopulmonary services including pulmonary rehabilitation and pulmonary function testing. During these classes, I felt an overwhelming sense of peace, and I knew that I found my place. This feeling was intensified when I completed rotations in those departments during my externship. I feel confident that I made the right choice and that I will be very happy with my career.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you decide to join &lt;a href="/academics/ssc/tech-opportunities-program"&gt;TOP&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I decided to join TOP because I needed all the help I could get. I literally put on the application, &amp;ldquo;I need all the help I can get.&amp;rdquo; I was a non-traditional student. I was 29 when I was accepted to Oregon Tech and a super senior attempting to afford college with no financial help. My son was three years old, and I did not have a job. TOP helped me get a job, find scholarships, and held me accountable in many ways. Honestly, I could not have gotten where I am today without TOP.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish students were not scared to ask for help. I wish it was not seen as a weakness to ask for and get help with academic and personal struggles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What fuels you to succeed?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My family fuels me to succeed. I never saw myself as someone who deserved success. Working with counselors, referred to me by TOP, helped me see that I am worthy of success and that my family will be better off if I accepted that and reached my goals.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose this major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose this major because I wanted to help others heal at a deep and profound level. I chose this major because I wanted to heal myself of the suffering that has been in my family and community for generations. It has been a long, hard road for me, yet many have assisted me and continue to encourage me up the mountain. I have dreamt of the day that I could return the favor and continue the legacy of helping others. I long to give back that which was generously given to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing in this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am passionate about changing the acceptance of alternative therapies, like hypnosis and guided imagery. Many of these techniques have not been extensively researched, sometimes due to the lack of funding. It is my goal to bring Evidence Based Practices to the field of alternative practices, so insurance companies will cover alternative therapies and reduce the need to prescribe medications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you decide to join &lt;a href="/academics/ssc/tech-opportunities-program"&gt;TOP&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My membership in TRIO began six years ago at Klamath Community College, when a fellow classmate suggested that I join the TRIO program. Before TRIO, I had no direction and no intention of ever taking a math class. Without TRIO, I never would have been able to survive the intense math requirements that I was so challenged by. I began in Math 10 and worked all the way through to statistics, which took a couple of years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish that everyone knew how committed OIT is to the community of Klamath Falls and to the betterment of the environment we live in. OIT takes an active role in helping us to recreate ourselves from the inside out, one student at time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is your favorite hobby, and do you have any experiences you would like to share regarding that hobby?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am a gifted artist by nature and anytime I can express myself in a creative way, I feel blessed. I hope that one day I will be able to mix business with pleasure and become an art therapist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What fuels you to succeed?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am absolutely driven by the need to make up the part of my life that I missed, when my life was tormented by alcoholism and addiction. I am consumed by the passion to learn, live and love, and I am compelled by my Spirit to pay it forward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Who is your favorite professor and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;That is the toughest question of all. I have loved every professor, and my life has been changed forever by each of them. If I had to narrow it down, I would say that Dr. Kristen Konkel and Dr. Trevor Petersen have each had a profound influence on my awesome experience here at OIT. Each of them have taught me and mentored me extensively along my journey towards success.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I chose Radiologic Science because I wanted to work in a field where I could make a difference in peoples’ lives every day...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose this program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Radiologic Science because I wanted to work in a field where I could make a difference in peoples&amp;rsquo; lives every day. Radiology is a career that is very versatile and allows for expansion in the workplace. Since the beginning on my externship, I have been able to work throughout the hospital and have learned so much. In radiology, I will be able to work in clinical settings, trauma cases, fluoroscopy, and the operating room. Medicine is an amazing profession because learning new things is a daily occurrence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing in this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Medicine is always advancing, and radiology is continually evolving as well. Radiology started with film and darkrooms, but now it has become almost fully digital across the world. Digital machines are much more user friendly and, most of the time, provide better patient comfort. I love to see the advancement of the trade and how digital machines can improve healthcare even more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many options I have with the degree. Within the scope of radiology, I can be certified in MRI, CT, mammography, cardiac catheterization lab, PACS, and quality assurance. I have chosen to rotate through CT and mammography. Once I complete my externship, I will be certified in both modalities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you decide to join &lt;a href="/academics/ssc/tech-opportunities-program"&gt;TOP&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wanted to join TOP because I wanted a group that would hold me accountable and could help me make connections on campus. My counselors were helpful in keeping me aware of my grades, reviewing my papers, and helping with my applications for financial aid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is not only a nerd school! I loved my schooling at Oregon Tech. The professors are all very helpful and truly want you to succeed. In Radiologic Science, the program basically lines you up with a job, and you often graduate with a job offer and a year of job experience. What other school can provide that?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What fuels you to succeed?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My family. I am the first in my family to graduate college, and I am very proud of that accomplishment. My parents are very encouraging and involved in my studies. They push me to succeed, always be my best, and give 100%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Who is your favorite professor and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have enjoyed all of my programmatic professors. Each one of them brings a specific knowledge to the profession and teaches according to the registry and from personal experience. They make sure that we are fully prepared for the externship by the time we leave and have the knowledge to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose this program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have always been interested in healthcare as well as learning about different cultures and communities. I came to Oregon Tech as a Pre-MIT student and got swept away by my Medical Sociology class, which lead to my current major in Population Health Management.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing in this particular field and why? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are so many ways that I want to use this major to make whatever area I end up in a healthier place to live. I am excited to use this degree to not only improve my community, but also to help other communities grow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you decide to join &lt;a href="/academics/ssc/tech-opportunities-program"&gt;TOP&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I joined TOP because I have been a part of TRIO programs for nine years and every moment of it has been a truly life changing experience. My high school TRIO program did so much for me in getting me where I am today, and I am glad that those experiences were able to continue into college through TOP.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oregon Tech is a great school with a diverse student body. It seems like sometimes this school is misrepresented in the general public for being a Tech School. I have had so much fun here&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;and met so many great people. In my opinion, we receive higher quality hands-on education as well as have closer, more personal relationships with the teachers and staff.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is your favorite hobby, and do you have any experiences you would like to share regarding that hobby?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have been a figure skater practically my whole life, and I was so excited to find out there is an ice arena here in Klamath Falls. I was fortunate enough to be able to work there for four years as regular staff as well as a figure skating instructor. It has been so much fun building relationships with people in the community through something that I love. It really is going to be hard to leave.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What fuels you to succeed?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am passionate about community health, so if I am succeeding then I am making the community a healthier place to live. I also want everyone who loves and supports me to feel proud of me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Who is your favorite professor and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have had so many good professors at this school. Professors who are willing to work with me and help me with anything, whether it is schoolwork, brainstorming potential jobs, or looking for internships. These teachers are passionate about what they teach and want everyone to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I chose Mechanical Engineering because I have always had a passion for cars...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose this program (major)?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Mechanical Engineering because I have always had a passion for cars. When I was young, I used to play with toy cars like Hot Wheels and Matchbox. As I got older, I was more fascinated with the history channel and shows like &lt;em&gt;Modern Marvels&lt;/em&gt; rather than trending shows of my time. At one point, I had the grand idea of designing my own car and decided to pursue engineering. Although I think I was a little na&amp;iuml;ve in thinking I could build and design my own car, I am still motivated to help design at least a part of a mainstream car so that as one drives by, I can say, "Hey, I helped design that".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you decide to join &lt;a href="/academics/ssc/tech-opportunities-program"&gt;TOP&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I made the decision to come to Oregon Tech, I was about to uproot myself from the comforts of home. Not being a social butterfly also made it hard for me to make friends. Therefore, my mom found out about the TOP program and the benefits it provides.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The one thing that I was hesitant about was the TOP Bridge program, which allowed TOP students to move into their rooms a week before the start of classes. At first, this terrified me as it meant that I had a week less at home. However, it turned out to be the best decision I made. Not only did I get to meet the wonderful mentors and counselors within TOP, but I also got to meet other TOP students. Suddenly, I was not alone. I had a great team working with me along with a pool of students who later became friends of mine. Thus, the reason I joined TOP was to be a step ahead of others and to break out of my social shell a bit. I knew that I would not have gotten through college without the guidance and wisdom of the TOP counselors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oregon Tech is not just an engineering school. People I have talked to assume that just because we have the word &amp;ldquo;tech&amp;rdquo; in our name, it must be an engineering school. However, the reality is that Oregon Tech has a diverse campus with medical, business, psychology, writing, and engineering disciplines. The small class size enhances the ability to learn, and the multi-disciplinary nature of Oregon Tech gives the opportunity to share similarities between disciplines as well as gain a better understanding and appreciation for other disciplines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is your favorite hobby, and do you have any experiences you would like to share regarding that hobby?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of my favorite hobbies is studying car design. I love watching documentaries on famous car manufacturers like Enzo Ferrari, Horacio Pagani, Elon Musk and Christian Von Koenigsegg. What appeals to me is the engineering spirit. Most of these designers had a dream of building their own car, and they succeeded despite many hurdles and hardships.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am especially interested in aerodynamics and how engineers are on the quest of making a car that can cut through the air like a knife. I remember watching a video on Christian Von Koenigsegg, founder of Koenigsegg, and he always said that his cars are designed to be fast but also have a certain degree of elegance and style. Horacio Pagani says that the inspiration for his company, Huayra, was an airplane wing. He wanted a car that was dynamic like the wings of an airplane during takeoff and landing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides the engineering involved, most of the designers I admire in this category came from humble roots. Koenegsegg is not a trained engineer, but rather a self-taught one. Enzo Ferrari never wanted a car business but needed one to fund his addiction to racing. It is the stories and the passion of these innovators that lead the way for the best cars on the planet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Who is your favorite professor and why? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sean Sloan is my favorite professor because I believe he is an engineer who has broken the status quo of engineering. He tries to explain complex concepts in creative ways rather than &amp;ldquo;beating&amp;rdquo; you with a book. He believes that while getting the right answer is great, the process of solving a problem is worth more. Try to ask professor Sloan about engineering ideas and maybe some abstract ones as well, and you could find yourself enveloped in the conversation and lose sense of time. Professor Sloan is very helpful, and I am sure I am not alone when I say that he is my favorite professor.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I chose this major for a few reasons...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose this program (major)?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose this major for a few reasons. First, I have always aspired to practice medicine and wanted the best education to prepare me for medical school. When I was looking at different degree options at various universities, Oregon Tech&amp;rsquo;s Bachelor of Science in Biology &amp;ndash; Health Sciences stood out due to the rigorous nature of the degree. I never thought I would be able to complete a biology degree, but here I am, graduating in sixteen days with my diploma. The second reason I elected to pursue this degree was simply because I have a genuine passion for all facets of biology. I would have to say that my favorite biology class was human anatomy and physiology. How the human body functions at a physiologic level never ceases to amaze me. Lastly, I chose this degree because of Oregon Tech&amp;rsquo;s high graduate school acceptance rate. I was very impressed and decided this degree was the best fit for me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing in this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since I have been accepted into a naturopathic medical school, I have developed a deep interest in how natural remedies can help patients depend less on pharmaceutical drugs. I hope to be a part of shifting medicine away from drug dependency and to empower people to take control of their health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fall 2018, I will begin graduate school at the National University of Health Sciences. I will pursue two doctorate degrees in naturopathic medicine and chiropractic medicine. After graduating, I plan to move back to Oregon in hopes of joining an established alternative medicine practice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you decide to join &lt;a href="/academics/ssc/tech-opportunities-program"&gt;TOP&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I made the choice years ago to join the TOP program because I envisioned it providing me additional support to get through college, which it has in an insurmountable way. Had I not joined TOP, I would have never been able to meet some of the greatest people on this campus and have the support and ongoing encouragement to stay motivated and finish my degree. Through TOP, I have gained more confidence and the ability to ask for help when I know I am struggling. I cannot be more grateful for such a great program because without TOP, I would not be the first person in my immediate family to graduate from college.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would tell future students that if they want to work hard and have a rigorous schedule, then this university is the place for them. From a personal standpoint, I would also tell them to live on campus for a year to get experience. Additionally, I would tell students to use campus resources, such as the Financial Aid Office, the Integrated Student Health Center, and TOP.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is your favorite hobby, and do you have any experiences you would like to share regarding that hobby?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This year I found myself to be interested in keeping snakes as pets. Snakes are interesting and never cease to amaze me. I have a few snakes, including a Burmese python named Banana, a western hognose named Digger, and a platinum reticulated python named Kaa. My boyfriend and I discovered this hobby together, and it helps us stay close and gives us something to do when we do not have school to tend to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What fuels you to succeed?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Knowing that I have been accepted to a graduate school has fueled me to stay motivated for the rest of this school year. Prior to hearing of my acceptance, what fueled me was my perseverance and undying dedication to finishing my degree. Completing my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree has so much meaning to it that sometimes I cannot express in words what it means to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Who is your favorite professor and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My all-time favorite professor on campus is Dr. Jherime L. Kellermann, Ph.D. because of the passion he has for teaching and learning. I have taken four classes with him, and I can sense he has extreme dedication to his students and his job.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>What I liked most about my time at Oregon Tech was the sense of community. The school staff were very involved...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current City: &lt;/strong&gt;Honolulu, Hawaii&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Job Title &amp;amp; Place of Employment: &lt;/strong&gt;Mechanical Engineer, Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard &amp;amp; IMF&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What did you like most about your time at Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I liked most about my time at Oregon Tech was the sense of community. The school staff were very involved with the students, and seemed to truly care about each individual. It didn't feel like separate entities, but more like a family that supported and encouraged each other to do their very best.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your profession?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like that I feel like I am contributing to something helpful. As an engineer there are various routes you can take, and a multitude of jobs at your feet. With this job, I&amp;nbsp;like that I am a part of something at the forefront of society that can make a big difference. That is important to me - using my degree for something that can benefit others, and in my current case, my country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How long after graduation did it take you to find a job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I found this job while still in school, actually. &amp;nbsp;I went to the career fair during the fall of my senior year and met up with the company through that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Did you participate in any externships during your time at Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I had a couple of different externships/internships. The first was at the Sheriff's Office of my hometown in Highlands Ranch, CO and the second was at a consulting engineering firm that took on mechanical, plumbing, and electrical jobs, mostly at universities and hospitals in Indiana.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How do you feel your time at Oregon Tech prepared you for your current job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I feel fairly well prepared for my current job. I know that there will be a lot of on the job training to learn the specifics of my position, but I feel comfortable picking up new things that I have a base knowledge for because of my classes at Oregon Tech.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What advice would you give to a current Mechanical Engineering student at Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would say to soak up everything you can. While there is a lot of information being thrown at you, and I know it will be very difficult to remember it all, remember what you can. Take advantage of the time professors give you outside of class and pick their brain. They want to share the knowledge that they have, and it is good for you as a student to dive into all sorts of different areas of knowledge, since each professor has a different background and a different story. Find out what you love and what drives you to want to put forth your best effort, because as you may already know, mechanical engineering covers a broad range of topics and that leaves it up to you to find your passion.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>Since graduating from Oregon Tech, I have heard from many graduate schools and employers that they love Oregon Tech grads...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Originally, I chose Oregon Tech because of the MIT programs, but soon after arriving I realized the medical field was not for me. Population Health Management (PHM) was in its very beginning stages at that point (the class of 2016 was the first set of graduates from that program), and I switched to that major because it was a statistics-heavy program which is what I was interested in pursuing after graduation. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved that PHM was, and still is, all about what the health and medical field needs right now. Dr. Nathenson and Stephanie Machado did (and still are) doing extensive research to make sure graduates are equipped with job-ready skills. I also loved that nearly all of our classes involved real-world research, rather than hypothetical scenarios.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Specifically, I am passionate about finding effective treatments, cures, and prevention tactics for autoimmune related conditions. In the US today, millions of people suffer from these conditions that are difficult to treat, and I would love to be a part of the research that positively impacts those with chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I want to teach at the college level and be able to conduct chronic disease research with my students.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favorite class at Oregon Tech was Stat Methods in Epidemiology, because that is the field I want to work in/what most interests me. I loved that it was challenging because it required a lot of critical thinking and problem solving, not because the content was too difficult.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Small class sizes are a huge advantage to students! In my experience, I never had an issue trying to speak with a professor or getting feedback/assistance on my work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Explore the outdoors! To me there&amp;rsquo;s nothing better than being outside and seeing what the world has to offer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;While I attended Oregon Tech I was a writer and then copy editor for the student newspaper, &lt;em&gt;The Edge&lt;/em&gt;. I feel like that helped me be more involved in everything going on around campus!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I participated in many internships/externships and gained a lot of experience. I would suggest that every student take as many opportunities for internships and externships as they can, as it not only provides experience, but also helps them make connections they may have for the rest of their lives!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Upon graduating from Oregon Tech in 2016, I worked a grant funded position at Klamath County Public Health for a year. Currently, I am gearing up to begin grad school at Oregon State, to pursue a Master of Public Health in Epidemiology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since graduating from Oregon Tech, I have heard from many graduate schools and employers that they love Oregon Tech grads. Going to a school with career-driven programs is a huge advantage!&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

They also offered small class sizes so I would receive more 1-on-1 time with my professors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love that it is so hands on. I actually get to do and see what I am learning about. We get to take x-rays, position each other, transport each other, perform needle sticks etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I enjoy helping others and that is why I went into the medical field. I love interacting with patients and expressing compassion with each person I meet in the hopes that I brighten their day just a little.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;What would be your dream job? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Working as the lead technologist at larger hospital that receives a lot of trauma cases. I am also interested in Forensic Radiology for down the road.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really enjoy my patient care class because we got to perform needle sticks, transport one another, and make our own plaster casts. It was very hands-on. I use a lot of what I learned in that class almost every day. I also really enjoyed my Positioning courses because they are the most pertinent to my job. But I can honestly say I use the information I learned in my courses every single day while I am on the job.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh gosh... there are so many things. Oregon Tech is just amazing all around. It provides so many opportunities for its students. The best advice is to get involved with the campus early on. Whether that's getting an on campus job, being in clubs, going to all the FREE activities that are put on, just do it. You will be 100X more successful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love hiking, chasing waterfalls, going to the coast, volunteering, cooking, and painting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I had my hands in a lot of different areas on campus. I had 3 on campus jobs at one point. I worked in athletics, student government, and was the Hootie Mascot. I also worked at the Women&amp;rsquo;s Resource Center for 1 year. I was the Administrative Affairs Officer for student government for a year. I sat on various committees for our college. I was the founder of the Circle K Club on campus and was an officer for 3 years. I helped with New Student Orientation for 2 years. I volunteered countless hours for various events as well. I hosted many different events on campus like an Operation Christmas Child Packing party during family weekend, scholarship nights with Financial Aid, 10+ craft nights, knitting parties, and many fundraisers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am currently doing a 1 year externship at Providence Medical Center in Medford, OR. Oregon Tech works really hard to provide their students with externships. Every single medical imaging student is guaranteed 1 externship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am hoping to apply for positions in Medford, Grants Pass, Klamath Falls, and Bend and start working full time. I am also hoping to go back to school to get my teaching degree and come back to Oregon Tech to teach Radiology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;You have made the best decision of your life about coming to OIT. You are going to love it here. Make sure to get involved but still stay focused on your studies. That is most important. School will always come first. It might take some time to figure out new study habits because it will be different from high school. Get help early on if you are struggling. The peer consulting center is AMAZING! Make sure you attend New Student Orientation!!! That is where you start making connections with people and will officially become at OIT Owl!!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>My labs and projects really give a sense of what engineering thinking and work is like.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h4&gt;Awards and Accomplishments while at Oregon Tech&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Fundraiser Coordinator for ASCE's 2018 Student Conference&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Business Manager for The Edge&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Most Dedicated Employee, The Edge, 2015&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Hardest Worker, The Edge, 2017&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech for a couple of reasons. The first being that my engineering advisor at Mt. Hood Community College went to Oregon Tech and initially got me interested in the school. I knew that the school was in southern Oregon from what my advisor told me and that it is very picturesque&amp;mdash;living in Portland my whole life made me want a change of scenery and to experience something new. When I researched the school and saw most engineering labs were hands-on, they have small class sizes and a lot of employers that hire for positions I am interested in specifically look for Oregon Tech graduates, I wanted to see the school for myself. I toured the school and some of the town and fell in love ultimately deciding this is the place for me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Honestly, the amazing professors that teach the classes. I truly believe their unique personalities and teaching styles really make the dullest of subjects interesting. I also like how we learn applicable skills and not just theory, being able to use what we have learned in the classroom and apply it to our projects whether it be in a lab, club, or community projects allows me to become more confident and love this school even more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am currently passionate about changing two main areas in this field. First, as a female engineering student, I am dedicated to challenging the notion that women in engineering have to adhere to traditional male roles and behaviors and I want to encourage them to consider careers in fields that have typically been associated with men. I believe that our field will be stronger if we allow each person to stay true to whom he or she really is, regardless of that person&amp;rsquo;s gender. Second, I am passionate about making our field as proficient and efficient as possible. Civil engineers play a very large part in making the world a better place, global warming and global disasters are just part of the domain of which civil engineers are responsible for; therefore achieving maximum productivity with minimum wasted effort and/or expense as well as being competent and skilled in this field is crucial. I would like to implement those two passions into the broad management side of civil engineering. I am interested in green infrastructure and sustainability. We deserve to have a healthy and safe planet, civil engineers are here to foster that development and I look forward to being a part of that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I do not have a specific title or position that I would like to have one day, all I have are aspirations of things I want to do and be a part of. I like helping people and businesses and/or organizations succeed. I like to be creative in terms of innovation and artisanship. I like to implement or do something new that I am noticed for. I like to experience new places and people. The list goes on and if somehow I could be fortunate enough to combine all of those into one job that is what it would be, whatever that is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of my classes have had at least one aspect that I favored, so I would say any class that has included topics involving how the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface is subjected to natural and man-made forces and how we as Civil Engineers can come up with creative solutions to ensure the safety of lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think that the hands-on education model is worth emphasizing. My labs and projects really give a sense of what engineering thinking and work is like. In addition, because Oregon Tech is a small school, the professors really care about their students and are always available to help. Also, with communication comes insight and knowledge; knowledge is power and will allow you to shape your University experience to your liking. Oregon Tech has so many opportunities whether it be taking you on a free life changing trip, helping you get that dream internship or job, or creating lifelong connections and/or memories so communicating with professors, other students, and on campus resources is important in getting the most bang for your buck.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like to relax with my dog and watch a variety of my favorite shows like the Big Bang Theory or Claws. When time permits, I like to indulge in one of my hobbies, photography. I love looking at the world from the perspective of a camera lens and to be able to create images that people can relate to and enjoy. When I attended Mt. Hood Community College I submitted my work for a photo contest and won first prize. I was excited to see that my work stood out and others enjoyed it as much as I did.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes. I am a member of &lt;em&gt;The Edge&lt;/em&gt; student newspaper, the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), the Leadership Academy and the Tech Opportunities Program (TOP). I was a writer for &lt;em&gt;The Edge&lt;/em&gt;, Oregon Tech&amp;rsquo;s student newspaper, for 11 months and have been the Business Manager since January 2017. I enjoy coming up with effective solutions to grow and promote the paper whether it be through the creation of onboarding paperwork or connecting with those in the campus and Klamath community. In ASCE, the title of Fundraiser Coordinator of the 2018 Student conference was granted to me, which has been the biggest role I have played in the club thus far. ASCE is really just the greatest club/society to be a part of because it strongly focuses on growing professionals for the civil engineering field; I have had so many great opportunities through the club like going to the 2016 ASCE National Convention in Portland, Oregon, the 2016 Meet a Civil Engineer Day in Portland, Oregon, the Workshop for Student Chapter Leaders in Los Angeles, California and the 2018 ASCE PNW Region Student Conference for Steel Bridge and Concrete Canoe in Boise, Idaho. In 2016-17 I helped design the Steel Bridge. Being part of the Leadership Academy allows me to grow my leadership skills through things like leadership summits and workshops, the academy provides opportunities like going on trips such as the 2017 NW Student Leadership Conference in Portland as well. I like being a part of SWE and TOP because I get to meet new people and just be a part of more great opportunities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish I had more of an understanding of just how remote Klamath is compared to Portland. I am definitely a city girl so actually moving to Klamath and not going back to the city during breaks was kind of rough. But when I found out that students get an amazing amazon prime discount and that being involved on campus allowed me to go on trips that let me experience new places outside of my hometown and Klamath that&amp;rsquo;s when I started to have a better University life in Klamath as a city girl. I would recommend researching early on all of the resources Oregon Tech and Klamath have to offer, like the trips and on campus events, great food trucks and some good restaurants in town, a good bowling place, a fun paint your own pottery shop, and there are lake activities you can do during the end of spring term/beginning of fall term along with constant outdoor things to do year round. If you have the option live on campus at least your first year is a really good idea. I could not because I have a dog but would have if I didn&amp;rsquo;t. Get a year round parking pass that lasts for a little over 4 terms as it is cost effective, traction tires work as good if not better than studded tires, some years it snows a lot and others barely at all, make sure you have a pair of sunglasses or two, college is hard but Oregon Tech cares about you succeeding and this school is a community so never be afraid of asking for help whether it is from your professors, the Dean of students or the amazing tutors in the peer consulting center and last but certainly not least stay positive and have a good time, you are only young once.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h4&gt;Awards and Accomplishments while at Oregon Tech&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul style="margin-left: 5px;"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Lambda Pi Eta&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Communications Honor Society&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;President's List&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Dean's List&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Non-traditional Student Representative in ASOIT&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3&gt;
Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Attended by Alumni Matthew Hunt (younger brother), and Melanie McClellan (my youngest sister), I have lived in Klamath since 2006. Oregon Tech had the quality that I was looking for, and the programs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you liek most about your major? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;How many different directions it can diversify, you can make your own job in whatever communication area you are interested in with this degree. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Helping others differentiate between the technology they need and don't need. Communication is so very broad and so very fun. I am passionate about this because of the major disconnect in technology usage between digital natives and digital immigrants (older generations). Technology can be made to work for you, or it can distract you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Writing fiction/science fiction etc. But what I am doing now is pretty fantastic!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Communication in Leadership. Great discussion times. Intercultural communication. And Technical and Advanced Technical writing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Communication degree students aren't slackers.  We work hard within the scope of getting the degree, as well as finding the job in the industry we like. A true treasure hunt. Our program is extremely valuable, so much so that some of the classes are requirements for other degree programs.  This is a great campus with very relatable instructors. I was never overlooked and the unique issues I had to deal with in the course of being a non-traditional student were accommodated. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What's your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Go to the movies and do community events with my friends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was in ASOIT, and I remain connected to the current student government as well as community and on campus elements related to the scope of my internship. I also worked for Career Services. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; I am in an externship at the moment, it is extremely valuable. When I am done, I am hoping this will be my full-time job.  The experience I am gaining in this position from an industry name and leader is fantastic. I am also learning that one of the huge takeaways from Oregon Tech is a massive sense of self-confidence. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduate?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I plan on working full time. I already have a job offer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about the campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are serious about getting a great education, with professors and assistants who actually care how well you do, this is the best school for you, and it&amp;rsquo;s so exciting as well, so many great changes coming up that will benefit the programs and student body.  &lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I like Communication Studies for its broad application across a number of fields, as well as its emphasis on hands-on work outside the college. </TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was part of the Dragonfly Transitions program from about 2012 to late 2013. They encourage the students in their program to study part-time at Oregon Tech, which I did. Once I graduated Dragonfly, I chose to remain at Oregon Tech due to the low cost and good-quality education, as well as having a fondness for both the school itself and people within Klamath Falls.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like Communication Studies for its broad application across a number of fields, as well as its emphasis on hands-on work outside the college. I have become a good deal better at interacting with people thanks to that major. As for Population Health Management, I have always had a vested personal interest in healthcare and improving health outcomes, and the degree is focused on improving an aspect of the world I find really needs improving &amp;ndash; especially within the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I want to eventually help contribute to a single-payer, two-tier, or universal health care system within the United States, something that I believe would be very possible if enough citizens could be educated about the alternatives to the current system. At present, the United States spends the most money in the world on health care and still has the worst outcomes among first world countries. Speaking as someone who was born in the United Kingdom and has dual citizenship, this is not acceptable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, it would be to write and voice act for videogames. This is just something I have a personal and longstanding interest in, and will likely pursue it on the side.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The recently retired Professor Marilyn Dyrud&amp;rsquo;s Business Ethics and the Holocaust class is one of the best classes I have taken, period, and I do hope someone picks up the reins on it now that she is gone. I also greatly enjoyed the Negotiation and Mediation classes with Professor Kevin Brown, and the COM 109 class with Professor Franny Howes. The best experience I have had so far overall was my externship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have a student newspaper. It exists! Read it! Pick up a copy or go to &lt;a href="https://theedgeot.com/"&gt;theedgeot.com&lt;/a&gt;. If nothing else, check out the satire edition, The Ledge, that we put out every so often.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What's your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I go to Dean Limb&amp;rsquo;s Klamath Strength and Conditioning gym about three times a week. I&amp;rsquo;ve met a lot of great people there, and it is great quality for the price. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m the editor in chief of the student newspaper, The Edge, so I&amp;rsquo;m one of the reasons the bins on campus sometimes inexplicably fill with Oregon Tech related stories or satire some people inevitably think is real. I am also the ASOIT representative for the recently-created Drama Club, and we will be putting on a show of Twelfth Night hopefully in the Spring of 2018, so keep an eye out; we will be holding auditions soon! I am also doing a Campus Maintenance job over the summer, so you can think me for your shampooed carpets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I did two externships through the Population Health Management major. The first was the Park and Play program over the summer of 2016. I got stationed in Stukel Park right across the street from Mills Elementary, and met a lot of great kids. Then, as an excellent segue, I worked with recent graduate and baseball player Wes Loy for my second externship in Mills Elementary, where a lot of the kids already knew me. We worked on reducing the fruit and vegetable waste in the cafeteria, and had a great deal of success in implementing some low-cost measures over the course of three terms! The externship will be continuing next year as well, and we will be presenting our work to a public health conference in Salem this October. I gained a lot of valuable experience from both of these externships and met a lot of really great people. It&amp;rsquo;s also really funny that when I ride the bus or go to Fred Meyer, I will occasionally get greeted by the kids that I worked with or their parents, some of whom know me by name, some of whom know me as &amp;ldquo;Park Man.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A few. If I remain in Klamath Falls, I would pursue work at Herald and News and with Blue Zones. I am also considering heading back to work for a wilderness program in Utah, one I participated in during the summer of 2012. I am also thinking about moving back to the United Kingdom, where my family is. I am not sure just yet. Maybe something will crystalize as I begin looking into career opportunities as graduation approaches. Right now, I have some statistics classes to fight through&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can get an Oregon Tech bus pass at the Financial Office. For $45 you can get unlimited rides for months at a time. Less helpful if you have a car already, but worth bearing in mind since this is the best deal you can get in town period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Check out Thai Orchid on Main Street for really good Thai food, Sherm&amp;rsquo;s Thunderbird has better prices for food than Fred Meyer and is just down the street from it, and Wubba&amp;rsquo;s will sell you a bathtub full of meat for $1000. If, you know, that&amp;rsquo;s what you want.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Integrated Student Health Center does counseling if you feel the need, and it is fully confidential. College life can become very stressful, so try not to forget it exists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All the staff at Oregon Tech are really helpful, so if you have questions about financial aid and such, the best solution is to go down in person to the office and talk to the people there. The hardest part of doing this is looking up what time the office is open.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are plenty of campus events going on &amp;ndash; joining a club or student program is an excellent way of keeping apprised of such activities. Definitely do not miss out on the yearly music festival held by KTEC and CAB.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have any interest in liberal arts, I would suggest the Arts, Literature, and Philosophy minor (ALPS) which only takes about a half dozen classes to complete and is a good way to get some mileage out of electives. Professors Yasha Rohwer and Ben Bunting are the people to talk to about this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The school makes you take Tech Writing because it loves you.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I've worked in Aerospace for a long time, and everyone I've talked to has been impressed with the engineers who come out of Oregon Tech.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose OIT for two reasons. Firstly, it's a good college! I've worked in Aerospace for a long time, and everyone I've talked to has been impressed with the engineers who come out of OIT. I've had the pleasure of working with and learning from several Oregon Tech graduates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
Secondly, I wanted to study here because of my father. He came to OIT in 1965 for electrical engineering. He quit after a year to become a commercial pilot, and did that for 35 years, so I'm sort of finishing what he started.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like mechanical engineering because of its versatility. MEs can be found doing all sorts of things in every industry. It is a very broad discipline, which leaves me with many choices for work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dream job? Building, operating, and servicing machinery for asteroid mining or on-orbit resource processing and manufacturing. Pretty much anything to do with that, as long as I get to go into space.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two of my favorite classes have been Machine Design 1 and 2, and Small Group Communications. I loved machine design because it put everything I had learned in previous courses together. We really had to use every tool we had, and learned a whole lot of new ones, in order to solve realistic engineering problems. Group Comms was a lot of fun because it got us engaged with each other. There were students from every one of OIT&amp;rsquo;s programs, and learning how to work with them was a wonderful experience. Engineering is all about team work; no one person can really design anything but the simplest thing in any kind of economical time frame. This Group Communications class was a great start for me in how to effectively build and work in a team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Off campus I like to go hiking and explore the area on my motorbike. There are beautiful forests crisscrossed with service roads. The national forests are a great place to spend free time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have been involved in ASME, and presented our work at the Project Symposium. This coming year I'm helping to start a rocketry club at OIT as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech, or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I had to say anything to incoming students, it would be RELAX! We have plenty of time, so don't cram your terms full of classes. Take one class each term that is fun, and don't sweat a D or an F. How we handle our failures is more important than constant success. An employer will want to see that you can learn from mistakes, rather than that you are perfect (no one is perfect).&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>My favorite thing about echo is the critical thinking involved. You are the eyes of the cardiologist and unless you get the image, they can't make the diagnosis.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon tech due to the small class sizes, and the hands on approach to learning. I also decided to attend Oregon Tech because my father is an Oregon Tech alum and received his bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Mechanical Engineering from here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favorite thing about echo is the critical thinking involved. You are the eyes of the cardiologist and unless you get the image, they can't make the diagnosis. Being an echocardiographer means understanding symptoms and history along with the patient&amp;rsquo;s presentation in order to piece together what the patient is going through and obtain the best images possible for the doctor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am very passionate about valve repair and replacement, and its impact into the treatment of congenital pediatric diseases. I hope to someday be involved to some extent in research projects aimed towards investigating how new valve replacement and repair methods can help create a better quality of life for pediatric patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job is to work as an echocardiographer in a large hospital and someday contribute to research projects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The best classes I have taken are the ones that I am able to apply right now in the field while on my externship. All of my scanning classes, pathophysiology, pharmacology, and invasive cardiology to name a few. All of these classes helped prepare me to work in the field, whether I knew it at the time or not. There are times when I remember something I was taught in class and can directly apply it to something I am doing in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In terms of return on investment and preparation for the future, Oregon Tech is the best. It is a hidden gem in terms of opportunity and the quality of the education that a student can receive here. There is a reason why Oregon Tech grads are so heavily sought after.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;During my time on campus I was heavily involved with campus life. I volunteered and had the chance to direct New Student Orientation in the fall. I also served as the echo clubs ASOIT representative, and served on a few committees for student government.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also worked as a 200 level Anatomy and Physiology TA for my last two years on campus. This job helped me discover my passion for teaching and helping my students achieve their goals within the classes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am currently completing my externship at the North Colorado Medical Center in Greeley Colorado. This externship serves as my senior year in the program and has already taught me countless life lessons.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do not be afraid of change, of the unfamiliar, or of the unexpected. It is okay to change your mind about your major, or realize midway through the year that this isn't for you. I changed my major three times before discovering echo. I wish as a college freshman I had more knowledge about exploring other majors and felt more supported when it came time to changing my major. I was so obsessed with the idea of immediately finding what I loved that I felt guilty about not liking the original major I started with. Never be afraid to try something new and step out of your comfort zone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>Everyone knows each other in the COM major. Our relationships with our professors are also much closer because of that. </TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m from Klamath Falls, so I already knew a lot about the school. It was a pretty easy choice for me honestly since I already knew about the success rate and it&amp;rsquo;d be financially smarter for me. I went to KCC after high school wanting to go into Graphic Design for Web Marketing, but at the time, Oregon Tech didn&amp;rsquo;t offer anything remotely close to it, so I joined CSET instead. Turns out I&amp;rsquo;m awful at math and better at writing, so I found that COM was a much better choice for me. No regrets with that choice at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone knows each other in the COM major. The major is small compared some others in this school, so it&amp;rsquo;s really hard to not know everyone in COM eventually. Our relationships with our professors are also much closer because of that. Students from other programs are surprised when they see us call our professors by their first name instead of Doctor or Professor. Also it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty diverse major because of the nature of the program, so you&amp;rsquo;ll meet people from all walks of life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to see a little more focus on marginalized fields like artifacts and game theory. There&amp;rsquo;s still a lot that can be discovered in these subjects, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to find where to look at times. The hardest part of this field is simply recognizing that a communicative phenomenon is actually happening. That&amp;rsquo;s because there&amp;rsquo;s no absolutes (laws) in communication, only rules.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were a lot of memorable classes I&amp;rsquo;ve taken, but COM Research was probably the most rewarding one. That class taught me how to apply concepts I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from other COM classes into real-world situations. It also gave me the opportunity to go to the NWCA at the Coeur d&amp;rsquo;Alene Resort in Idaho to present my research paper with other students. I&amp;rsquo;d recommend every COM student to continue with their research project just to go to the conference; it&amp;rsquo;s worth the extra effort put into the paper.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What's your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hang out at our local hobby shop, Basin Gaming. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t even into cards at all until some friends invited me to play cards while I was a student at KCC. Oddly enough, I was recommended to check out the COM program after I dropped out of CSET because one of the COM alumni frequented the store. So without this hobby, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be here today (as weird as that may seem). I&amp;rsquo;ve had countless memorable experiences and met so many great people through this hobby and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more grateful. As a bonus, I even got employed there part-time and couldn&amp;rsquo;t have asked for a better job while in school!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Potentially going to graduate school after my time in the Air Force; not quite sure yet. If I do, I&amp;rsquo;d want to be able to apply new leadership and life experiences towards any future higher education. More importantly, I&amp;rsquo;d like a break from school&amp;mdash;I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s deserved after I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing it essentially my entire life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I feel obligated to relate my personal philosophy with a COM twist: Really take the time to reflect on the experiences you&amp;rsquo;ve had during your objectives. You may end up learning something that&amp;rsquo;s more important than your goal along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>As a graduate of the Renewable Energy Engineering program, I am equipped with the necessary knowledge to affect real change in the world...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h4&gt;Awards/Accomplishments while at Oregon Tech:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Most Dedicated Student Award 2017&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;President's ETM Senior Cup 2017&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Top Scholar of Electrical Engineering Class of 2017&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Presented at the ASEE PNW Section Conference 2017&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;When looking for schools to attend, I was hoping to go the West Coast, and that's when I learned about Oregon Tech. I chose Oregon Tech because it is well-known for its Renewable Energy Engineering Program, being one of the first to be ABET Accredited.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things I like about my major. The main thing would be what it has equipped me with. As a graduate of the Renewable Energy Engineering program, I am equipped with the necessary knowledge to affect real change in the world and help save our planet by utilizing alternative energy resources that are abundant but not efficiently employed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would like to increase awareness regarding renewable energy, and help make it available for more people. By integrating more renewable energy sources, and making more people aware of their benefits, we can significantly reduce our footprint on the environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job would be a power systems engineer, where I get to design and implement more renewable and efficient power systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Electronics classes would be my favorite classes. After taking the first electronics class, I realized that I like the electrical side of renewable engineering the most, and decided to dual in renewable and electrical engineering.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oregon Tech, even if it is a small school has a lot to offer! Everyone is supportive and helpful. It is one great family I'm proud to be a part of!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, I am! I have been an active member of the international club since I started school. I served as the President of the club in 2015 - 2016 academic year. I worked as an office assistant in the international student services for more than two years. This past year, I served as the student representative in the International Committee, the Corresponding Secretary for the Engineering Honor Society, and the Student Director of the Diversity Center. I was in charge of coordinating and planning the engineer&amp;rsquo;s week 2017 activities. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am currently interviewing for graduate school and some jobs. My hope is to get accepted at Masdar Institute of Science and Technology to study power engineering, and work at the same time to gain hands-on experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of resources dedicated to see students succeed! If you need help, all you have to do is ask! The four years you will spend at Oregon Tech will be ones of the best of your life, where you will get to learn about what you are passionate about, and meet and make friends from all around the world!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech because I wanted to move out of the Midwest. Oregon Tech appealed to me because the low student:teacher ratio and the prestige of our civil engineering program.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Civil engineering is relevant to everyday life. You can design or build, and work with transportation or structures, making it a versatile field. Civil also allows me to apply math and science, my favorite subjects, in interesting and new ways.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Autonomous vehicles. There are already concept vehicles, and I believe they will be fully autonomous in our lifetime. The transportation/traffic aspect of engineering must adapt to this new idea, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to be a part of it.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job would be to engineer new roadways and intersections for autonomous vehicles.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Traffic engineering because programming/designing an intersection based on an intersection in town was insightful and fun for me. Strength and Materials is my other choice because it included many fun/hands-on labs that visually demonstrated what was being taught.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I enjoy hiking, either in Oregon or northern California. Walking around Downtown Klamath is also nice.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am involved in our civil engineering club, ASCE-AGC. First as the secretary and now as president. ASCE-AGC helps OIT students prepare for what the civil engineering world requires by doing projects from design to build, and participating in ASCE and AGC events/workshops.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>The psychology program has taught me so much about how people think and behave. </TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech for a few main reasons. When looking at potential schools after finishing my associate&amp;rsquo;s degree at Shasta College in Redding and two years as a basketball player, I knew I wanted to continue to play basketball. So one of the first factors I looked for was somewhere that would give me an opportunity to play. I also wanted to go somewhere that had incredible academics as well. OIT gave me the best of both, while also keeping me close to home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your major? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love people. I love relationships and I'm always looking for ways to get better at relationships. The psychology program has taught me so much about how people think and behave. I have also really enjoyed getting to dig deeper into childhood behavior and learning how to incorporate programs to change behavior if need be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am passionate about teaching women that they are so much more worthy than what society says about them. I want to learn more about the way women think and teach the importance of using real and authentic models/actors on media and in the entertainment industry. Too often women play the "comparison game" where they feel inadequate or less than. I want young women to believe that what is in their hearts is the most valuable part about them. That ALL women are uniquely beautiful no matter the number on the scale. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job would be anything where I get to travel. I would love to work with young women and teach them about self-love and self-worth. Starting a women's ministry and speaking to large groups of young women about their dreams and passions would be MY biggest dream coming true. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why? &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved human development because it doesn't focus on just one thing like other classes. You get to learn about behavior patterns and thoughts from a young baby to an adult. Life is so beautiful and I really enjoyed getting to learn about how the brain develops! I also really enjoyed conflict negotiation because I thought it was one of the most realistic classes for me. I find myself using tools I learned in that class all the time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think people get turned away from the school because it's not by the beach or in the best weather (it gets cold here!). However, the staff is INCREDIBLE and offers so much support if you ask for it. If every student knew how helpful the professors truly are, I think their college experiences could be much better!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What's your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Traveling. It's such a millennial thing for me to love, but it's so fitting. I recently went to Europe and it changed my life. I hope to visit 25 states before I&amp;rsquo;m 25. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? if so, how?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am a captain on the women's basketball team and I am also a writer for our school newspaper. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I will be doing my externship this year. I will be teaching Sunday school at a local church to 5th graders and I know I will take away many incredible experiences!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would really like to get a TEFL (teaching English as a foreign language) certificate and travel abroad to teach English.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Anything else to share with future students? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Get involved on campus. I was fortunate enough to have basketball community waiting for me right when I got here, but if you do not play sports it is so important to join a club or a team so that you have people to go through this journey with!&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I’m passionate about changing how many women are actually involved in not only engineering, but STEM fields in general because our society can only improve by including as many different voices and minds in STEM. </TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech because it was an out of state college for me, and I wanted to build professional relationships in the area in order to pursue a career in the Pacific Northwest/ west coast.  I also saw that OIT&amp;rsquo;s class sizes were ideal to me, the MECOP program sounded good, and good graduation stats.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love how diverse the field is. Mechanical engineering holds so many different opportunities in itself.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about changing how many women are actually involved in not only engineering, but STEM fields in general because our society can only improve by including as many different voices and minds in STEM. There need to be more women in STEM than there are now and in order to get there, we need to start supporting the mindset that these fields are possible for anyone and everyone, and representation in the fields is so important as well.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job would be with a mid-size company where I have a lot of flexibility in my day to day work. My dream job would also be for a company that values diversity, their employees in general, and the environment as much as they do making money.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Within my major, my favorite classes have been the solid modeling courses. I love how this skill helps me take an idea from my head, puts it onto a screen where I can see how feasible it is and adjust it in any way I need to, and ultimately have it become a real life 3-dimensional thing.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
Another favorite class of mine is WRI420 &amp;ndash; Document Design. I took this course for my minor in Technical Communications and it was so great. The class material falls closely to graphic design which is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in for a very long time.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish everyone knew how great and hands on the programs are here. There are some people I know that once they hear &amp;ldquo;institute&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;college/university&amp;rdquo; they write the school off.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favorite thing to do off campus is graphic design work for my friends and family. Year round I&amp;rsquo;ll be working on a party invitation, graduation poster, or flyer for them.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m involved with two clubs on campus: Society of Women Engineers (SWE) and the Engineering Honor Society (EHS). In SWE, we hold the Engineer for a Day event where we invite students from the area to work on engineering kits our club develops in order to get them interested in STEM. This event is hosted during Engineer&amp;rsquo;s Week which is hosted by EHS.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have participated in two internships through the MECOP program. My first internship was at Consolidated Metco (ConMet) where they develop heavy duty trucking transportation component, and there I worked more on the manufacturing side of my major. It was really about learning how working in the &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; is really like and the importance of having any sort of process that is repeatable and reliable in order to have repeatable results. My second internship was with Medline ReNewal where medical devices are reprocessed in order to promote sustainability. During this internship I was able to do a lot of design work and work on more high priority projects which taught me how to set reasonable deadlines.

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I decided on Oregon Tech because it was one of the top schools in the state; I came to this school many times while I have lived here. This place as always instilled a sense of inspiration.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have two majors, the first being Biology, I love learning about the complexities of the human body, and the world. Most science majors are incredibly intelligent, but that intelligence can sometimes conflict with business needs. I wanted a Management degree so I can deal with these individuals daily.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job would be either the Dean of Medicine at a hospital, or working for the CDC.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ethics class was one of my favorite classes, it challenges you to have more behind, &amp;ldquo;well that&amp;rsquo;s what I believe.&amp;rdquo; If you don&amp;rsquo;t have sound reasons for thinking one way, you are on ever shifting ground, and that can be problematic.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, I have a job waiting for me.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t buy the meal plans unless you plan on using them. Rent your humanities, social science books, buy your science books if you can. If living off campus, try to plan not to take your car, because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to fight for a parking space.

    <TeaserText>I feel like a counselor. I used to have difficulties dealing with some patients at work, but not anymore. The applied psychology program taught me how to encourage my patients...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech Online?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My journey at Oregon Tech Online began 4 years ago. I was considering changing careers, and decided to look at accredited online programs nationwide. Of the 25+ schools I came across online, I chose Oregon Tech Online because they were not pushy. In fact, the program director made me shadow a professional to make sure that I was really interested in the program - before accepting my application.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What did you like best about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favorite part about my major was the discussions. The discussions were unlike any I had been a part of. they were engaging, and at times felt like I was in a real life therapy session. There were arguments, but none led to anything serious.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What has been the greatest aspect of completing your degree online?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I feel like a counselor. I used to have difficulties dealing with some patients at work, but not anymore. The applied psychology program taught me how to encourage my patients and make them happy. A key note I learned from the program was that everyone was different, so as a healthcare professional, you had to work your hardest to accommodate everyone. The program also helped me to become a better father and husband.
 I have 4 daughters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have any advice for incoming students?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oregon Tech Online is the best out there. It's the best because the majority of the professors have a PhD. You have to work hard but it pays off in the end. That's because you graduate with experience, and companies out there are aware of the high standard education and/or training we receive. That's why graduates of Oregon Tech are not only in demand, they are offered the best.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you found employment? How long after graduation did it take?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The applied psychology degree is my third from Oregon Tech. My first was a certification in polysomnography. As cheese as this may sound, I was offered a position before I graduated. I did not accept that position as I wanted to focus on my studies. It took only two weeks after applying for positions to sign a lucrative offer. And I was working within a month. With my recently acquired degrees in applied psychology and polysomnography, I will be seeking a consulting position in sleep medicine. One thing I have to say is that it has been too easy to find jobs, and I think that part of that is because of my alma matter. So, thank you Oregon Tech!</Biography>

    <TeaserText>Cadaver Imaging was such an amazing experience. Oregon Tech is one of two schools in the country that allows x-ray students to image a cadaver. </TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class="CallOut"&gt;Awards and Accomplishments while at Oregon Tech:&lt;/span&gt; ASOIT Administrative officer, ASOIT Communications Officer, Golf team, and part of Cadaver imaging group&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is an Oregon school, has small class sizes, a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in my chosen field, and is hands-on and well respected in the medical industry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your major?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 11 month externship, the clinical application to the two years of didactic work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;I do it this way because that is the way I&amp;rsquo;ve always done it&amp;rdquo; attitude. There are so many different ways to do things, and everyone can contribute. By changing this mentality the field can grow and patient&amp;rsquo;s care can be done more quickly and efficiently.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;To work at a clinic in MRI.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cadaver Imaging was such an amazing experience. Oregon Tech is one of two schools in the country that allows x-ray students to image a cadaver. This allows problem solving while taking pictures of a human body, instead of the phantoms we have in lab. We had the ability to discover pathology as well as to research and come up with our own theories. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The teachers really care, almost all of them have worked in the field that they teach in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite thing to do off campus? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Go golfing at the three different golf courses in Klamath- Running Y, Reams, and Harbor Isles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A member of Alpha Sigma Alpha the sorority that used to be on campus, ASOIT (Associated Students of OIT) for two years, the Rad Science club, and I was an Admissions Ambassador.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am currently on externship, and it has been a great experience. I am learning the clinical side of my field while learning how to work in the hospital with other techs, the learning curve has been hard, but definitely worth it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have thought about obtaining my master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Radiologic science with and emphasis in administration, and work in management, as well as education and eventually coming back to OIT and teaching.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take as many college credits as you can in high school, it will pay off.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I’ve gained experience with vulnerability scanning, network monitoring systems, configuring firewalls, and setting up new, secure systems...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;Attending Oregon Tech has given my life direction. It&amp;rsquo;s given me goals to work towards, and accomplishments to feel proud of. I&amp;rsquo;m most excited about the opportunity given by the Cyber Defense Center. Here, I&amp;rsquo;ve gained experience with vulnerability scanning, network monitoring systems, configuring firewalls, and setting up new, secure systems. The support from our cybersecurity experts here is amazing, they&amp;rsquo;re always there for us if we have questions or issues. In my free time, I like to read / listen to audiobooks, play PC games, and tinker in my home lab. Eventually, I&amp;rsquo;d like to work for US intelligence services, or the military, on national defense.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;Hello, I'm Zoe Winter. I have enjoyed working at Oregon Tech's new Cyber Defense Center since it began. As a student worker, being able to receive real industry experience has been invaluable. I've been learning network management, how to use security tool and appliances, and using all the skills I've developed at school. With the support of staff and teachers I feel confident that the Cyber Defense Center will help me build the career I want.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I want to work in publishing as an editor, but my dream job is to be a published author...</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I had decided to transfer somewhere as a communication major and my top pick was Washington State University, but my mom suggested Oregon Tech for convenience reasons (My younger brother was planning on attending) and the communication program here seemed like a better fit for me when I looked into it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What interests you about the Professional Writing program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is exactly what I wanted to do with the Communication major, but more focused on my personal talents and interests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I want to work in publishing as an editor, but my dream job is to be a published author. I am currently working on my first novel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish Oregon Tech marketed their programs outside of the medical science and engineering programs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am the treasurer of the Oregon Tech Spirit Squad, a cheerleading club on campus that cheers and performs at Basketball games. I am also the copy editor for the Edge, the student newspaper on campus. I am a former Edge writer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The campus is small and quiet. You see the same people regularly either in class or in the hallways. This makes connecting with friends and building relationships with classmates easier. You won&amp;rsquo;t have to introduce yourself to a completely new batch of students every class, each term.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I love the hands-on experience I get here! As a DMS student we use the machines daily. </TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awards/Accomplishments while at Oregon Tech:&lt;/strong&gt; President of the DMS Club&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;After choosing my major I conducted many hours of research on what programs were available. Oregon Tech had the only accredited program that not only offered my degree but provided a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s which included one year of externship experience. The school offered small class sizes, which meant lots of hands on learning and one on one time with the professors. The job placement and return on investment for students attending OIT is&amp;nbsp;one of the best in the nation which really made OIT stand out to me. In a time when establishing jobs and careers seems increasingly hard for graduating students, OIT seemed to be the school that best prepared their students for their chosen career paths.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love the hands-on experience I get here! As a DMS student we use the machines daily. You start scanning week 1 of the program and for the next few years all your experience isn&amp;rsquo;t just from lectures or studying, but from direct application, practicing and utilizing the same type of machines that you will be using for the rest of your career.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hope to be a part of the advancing technology and utilization of ultrasound for more procedures and studies. Ultrasound is constantly evolving and since we don&amp;rsquo;t use radiation and are non-invasive, the appeal for ultrasound rather than other imaging such as CT or MRI is high. If we continue to research and develop methods in which ultrasound can be utilized more often, we can create a less harmful and overall better experience for our patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job would be to work as a general sonographer in the Portland area. I love that as sonographers we can scan so many parts of the body and I plan to be ARDMS certified in several specializations so I can have a more versatile job.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to pick a favorite class because I love all of my classes. Each and every class is specific to my field of study and our professors are all so passionate about us really learning the information. But my absolute favorite class would have to be lab, because we really get time for one on one instruction with scanning actual patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The caliber of these professors is on another level. The professors here invest so much of themselves into making sure that your degree program is the right fit for you, and that you succeed in your schooling and your career. The passion these professors have, not only for what they are teaching but for the students as well, makes it feel like I always have someone in my corner making sure that I am well prepared for my career out in the real world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am the president of the DMS club at OIT. We run events for all classes of the DMS program and actively participate in volunteer opportunities within the OIT and Klamath community. Throughout the year we put on many fundraisers and donate a portion of our proceeds to charity. Being a part of the DMS Club has created a real feeling of community and family for all our DMS and OIT comrades.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I will be going on externship in June of 2018 and will be an extern for 1 year before graduating with my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree from OIT. I am very excited to gain real world experience working directly with experts in my field.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, I hope to be employed as a general sonographer within a hospital setting in the Portland metro area. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any jobs lined up, but I hope to make some potential connections through my externship. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Klamath Falls campus is a much smaller campus than many of other state schools and universities. It is important to be active within the school and the community to really get the most out of your school experience. On-campus housing is a great way to make friends and connections. Plan carpool trips to Costco and Trader Joe's in Medford, make use of $1 bowling at the Epicenter, go to the outdoor ice skating rink during the winter season, and take advantage of all the amazing outdoor activities that Klamath Falls has to offer. You&amp;rsquo;d be amazed at how such a small town can really make you feel at home.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech because I saw great value. One of the figures that stood out to me when looking at schools was the return on investment, and Oregon Tech excels in that field.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I like about the business management program is hands-on learning. On my first day of my first marketing class we were already creating content that would actually be posted to the school&amp;rsquo;s social media. I love marketing because it combines creative thinking with data and statistics, two things I enjoy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job would be to work on a professional sports team&amp;rsquo;s marketing team. I have always been drawn to sports and would enjoy working around them. Working for any professional sports teams in Portland would be as good as it gets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed principles of management because we got to dive into the history of some of the greatest leaders to ever live. Their stories were inspiring to say the least. I also enjoyed my databases class that has taught us how to create useful databases. It is a very applicable skill to be able to build a database. I can see it being very useful, especially if I ever get involved in a small business.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; I wish everyone knew how beautiful it is here. There is a sunset almost every night, the rolling hills are beautiful, and the view of Klamath Lake from campus is amazing. And when the snow falls and covers everything in a blanket of white, it&amp;rsquo;s a whole new beautiful. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I work for the Men&amp;rsquo;s Basketball team and with the athletics department as a whole. I create graphics for the athletics website, take photos at games, and help run social media. I go to almost every home sporting event. These jobs have also given me many opportunities to design. I designed the home basketball game ticket stubs, the game day program cover, and many of the animations that plat on the video boards during games.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Get involved in some campus activity. It&amp;rsquo;s the best way to meet people and discover passions at the same time!&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h4&gt;Dean's and President's List, Softball 2017 All-Conference Honorable Mention, &lt;br /&gt;
2017 Gold Glove&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;(I am a junior college transfer student) I wanted to continue playing softball in college, but I wasn't going to continue playing if I couldn't find a school to play for that could meet my personal preferences as well as provide me with a great education. I visited OIT with my father. He was prepared to dislike it, I was more open, but post tour and adviser/coach meetings we both left convinced this was the place for me.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love how small it is, there's 37 of us! I transferred in as a junior, but after the first year I feel very comfortable with all of my peers and professors.&amp;nbsp; I get the opportunity to work on projects and personally work with local businesses that I wouldn't have had the opportunity to if our program had the same number of students as larger universities.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Marketing jobs vary greatly so your impact can be seen in any aspect of the business world.&amp;nbsp; I want to be part of the reason a company grows and thrives, as well as sharing with the world a product/service that can impact their lives for good.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would be part of the huge and intricate process of creating a Super Bowl ad.&amp;nbsp; The most watched event of the year with the most iconic commercials and I could say I was small part of it.&amp;nbsp; But, landing a career within content marketing is my goal.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Social media marketing: I keep getting involved with social media projects and jobs. It was a great class to teach the marketing aspects of the platforms and it was very fun! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Business Graphic Design: I use Photoshop often, but I'm self-taught. This class taught me more about the program, as well as others within the Adobe Creative Suite for business projects such as making logos, brochures, and business cards. I like the classes that allow me to use my creativity!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;That we have a business department! And a really high quality one as well! We get drowned out by the engineers and health majors, but our business programs are producing quality and career ready graduates as well.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I had an internship over the summer with a small law firm back in Washington with the position of social media manager - that was interesting considering my lack of knowledge about law.&amp;nbsp; I also am working for Oregon Tech Alumni Association and creating a social media marketing plan, guide, and schedule.&amp;nbsp; I never really thought I'd be so involved in social media marketing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I do not currently have any positions lined up, but I have been looking online at potential positions available back home and I am excited to start applying.&amp;nbsp; I met a news reporter-anchor from the Western, WA news station, KOMO 4 News, here at Oregon Tech during an auction and they mentioned there is a social media position available at their station.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don't run away from the little town and campus, the surrounding environment makes up for it such as the Lava Beds, waterfalls, hot springs, Crater Lake, hikes and trails, and a beautiful sunset everyday over Klamath Lake.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>We work a lot on real life projects, which is what really prepares us for the future. </TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I came to Oregon Tech because I really wanted to study abroad in the U.S. and play college basketball as well. Oregon Tech was the school that could give me the best combination of both. They offered the degree I wanted and have one of the best NAIA basketball programs.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really enjoy the small class sizes. I also like that all the professors have work experience in the field and that it translates into how they teach the classes. We work a lot on real life projects, which is what really prepares us for the future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I mostly enjoy marketing classes. I like to come up with new ideas to improve things. Also, as I said before, we work on real life projects with local business, which in my opinion, it is the best way to learn.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think that something that is not advertised enough is that all professors have work experience in their respective fields. And that really makes a difference when it comes to prepare students for their professional future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>At OIT, most classes teach in lecture and later the knowledge is applied in labs.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;What drew you to Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012/2013 I was a foreign exchange student here in Klamath Falls. I really enjoyed my experience throughout the high school year here and decided I want to come back for college after finishing school in Germany. Many people I&amp;rsquo;ve met here in town always told me what an excellent school Oregon Tech is and especially the high hire rates right after graduation had me very interested. My goal has been and still is to become a permanent U.S. resident and I am convinced that OIT is the perfect fit to achieve my goal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What interests you most about your program?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Dad is a mechanical engineer which gave me many insights to his everyday work experiences. I generally loved the idea of becoming an engineer since my mind just works in an &amp;ldquo;engineers-way&amp;rdquo;. However I noticed the long hours my Dad spent in design in front of a screen and I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it. He also has co-workers who are manufacturing engineers and during a short two week internship I discovered that that&amp;rsquo;s what I want to do. Mainly because it&amp;rsquo;s a lot of &lt;strong&gt;hands-on problem solving&lt;/strong&gt; which is also what Oregon Tech really focuses on teaching.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I find most impressive and also important is how many labs Oregon Tech offers. During my school time in Germany, teaching mainly involved textbooks and solving problems on paper. At OIT, most classes teach in lecture and later the knowledge is applied in labs. In my opinion, hands on experiences from labs are far more valuable than reading books because it prepares students for future jobs in a way nothing else could.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dream job would be working as a manufacturing engineering in a small to medium sized company. The reason is that the work environment is much more personal, the responsibilities are broader and the everyday work changes constantly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite classes at OIT so far were the CAD/Solid modeling classes and Numerical Controls, which is the introduction to CNC. I really enjoyed the fact that these classes provided a great picture of everyday tasks for a manufacturing engineer. Like I said earlier, I just really like hands-on experiences!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing Oregon Tech has taught me is that job-wise pretty much anything is possible. The most important thing is to get out there and start talking to companies. I was amazed how easy it really is to establish good connections this way, compared to what one might think before trying.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first involvement was starting to work at the college union info-desk. What I really enjoy about it is how close I get to work with fellow students, staff and visitors. The job itself has taught me a lot about leadership, management, service orientation and campus itself. Over the last year I&amp;lsquo;ve also joined the Baja racing team and I&amp;lsquo;m helping the cheerleading team whenever I can.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my freshman year I got my first manufacturing engineering internship. Those 3 summer months in a small potato packing shed in Malin, OR really made me look forward to graduating and getting a job. Even though I didn&amp;rsquo;t have too many engineering classes throughout my freshman year, I learned many things that helped me with classes later on. After my sophomore year I was an intern for 3 months at a construction company which once again let me apply lots of coursework to real world experiences and I gained many skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about attending Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like outdoor activities such as hunting, fishing, hiking, off-roading or winter sports as much as I do, Oregon Tech is in the perfect location. It&amp;rsquo;s also important to mention that Oregon Techs classes aren&amp;rsquo;t easy, but the professors make sure students understand the material covered since that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s most important to have a successful career straight after graduation. I would also like to mention that OIT doesn&amp;rsquo;t only teach you in your particular field of study, but also offers many very valuable opportunities to learn how to be more successful in job search etc.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I chose Oregon Tech because of the small classes and the high job placement rate.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech because of the small classes and the high job placement rate (getting a job right after graduation). I enjoy being surrounded by students who want to graduate college, instead of people who just want to party during college.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love that my program is small. Being in the I.T. department I have the same classmates in almost all my classes. I enjoy the collaboration my classmates and I have with labs and non-major related classes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are your passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about working with databases, whether it is building, creating, updating, and/or maintain data. I love to interpret data and give data meaning so businesses can find ways to grow and/or improve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of my favorite classes at Oregon Tech are my core classes. I love them because I learn valuable skills, I enjoy learning from my advisor and other classmates. Labs in my core class are fun for me, because having a small class means labs turn into group projects and students help one another. I enjoy the comradery my classmates and I have.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My first year at Oregon Tech I ran Cross Country, Track &amp;amp; Field for Oregon Tech. Now I spend my winter term snowboarding with my friends in the Outdoor Program (O.P.) and occasionally go on the O.P.&amp;rsquo;s camping trips.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;At first, I was not really planning on doing an internship, but my senior project had a summer internship that tied in with the project. So, I spent summer 2017 interning at Klamath Irrigation District collecting data and understanding the company&amp;rsquo;s workflow in order to build a database and web page for a water usage and tracking accountability system.&amp;nbsp; I have learned vital information from this ongoing experience. I gained a lot of technical confidence in myself, and validation/satisfaction I have chosen the correct major.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Try to make some friends in your core classes. Friends will help you pass your classes. If you are serious about graduating with a degree and wanting a job, then Oregon Tech would fit for you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>The civil engineering program is such a good balance of classroom and practical work. </TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad graduated from Oregon Tech with his civil engineering degree. I heard about the good program from him and many of the other OIT graduates who work at the Washington Department of Transportation. When I decided to pursue civil engineering, it was the only choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you like most about your program? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civil engineering program is such a good balance of classroom and practical work. We are learning concepts and the theory behind engineering, but then we get to go out to the labs and put them right into practice. The work is challenging, but working on group projects or studying for the FE together creates a real sense of community among the students. The faculty are also the best on campus. They know their technical stuff, but are also interested in helping students succeed, whether that is academically, professionally, or personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of my professors put it, my passion is designing for &amp;ldquo;small-town America. &amp;ldquo; I hope to develop creative solutions to American transportation issues, specifically in car-centric rural environments, that meet the local economic goals and match the community lifestyle. Because of my experience at WSDOT, I completely understand the importance that vehicles have, and will continue to have, in rural towns and hope to become skilled at meeting the needs of all types of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would be your dream job? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I graduate, I hope to work for a private engineering firm in the Pacific Northwest that specializes in transportation planning and design. The previous six summers I have been interning with WSDOT, which has allowed me to determine areas that I like or do not like. This summer was spend on a bicycle transportation-planning seminar, which completely changed the emphasis of my study (and future career) to multimodal transportation solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graduate level transportation courses are excellent! Each course has a large project that allows to me combine the technical and communication skills that I have been honing during my time here at Oregon Tech &amp;ndash; the work is engaging and the end result something that I am extremely proud of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small class sizes at Oregon Tech are awesome. They allow students the ability to get to know their fellow students and faculty. These connections are the ones that get students internships, jobs, officer positions, study abroad trips, opportunities that are not as widely available at large schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have held multiple officer positions for the ITE Student Chapter, which has been one of the highlights of my time at Oregon Tech. I want to pursue transportation design, so an entire club dedicated to my field was a natural place for me to get involved. There are a few other clubs and committees that I hold positions in, including OIT Christian Fellowship, the American Society of Civil Engineers Concrete Canoe Team, the Cornett Hall Architectural Committee, and the Engineering Honor Society.&amp;nbsp; Lastly, I served as the project manager for my senior project team, which did an Alternatives Analysis for the KID C-Flume Replacement Project in Klamath Falls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an intern, I worked in three offices with WSDOT over the course of six years, including program management, construction, and design. Though the work challenged me, it gave me an intimate knowledge of the highway design and construction process. The theoretical principles that I learn in school make more sense when I can connect them to my own construction and design experiences on the job site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Get involved! I showed up to Oregon Tech with no intention of hanging out longer than necessary. I ended up signing up for the MSCE program because of the relationships I have established on campus. There is so much support available and clubs in your interest areas &amp;ndash; life extends far beyond the classroom here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

    <TeaserText>I am so grateful for the small class sizes, and our close relationship to our instructors and classmates.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since high school I have been interested in the career specific programs that Oregon Tech has to offer. Oregon Tech is also close to my hometown, Medford, Oregon, which made the decision to go even easier.&amp;nbsp; After a campus visit and tour of the MIT programs, I knew it was the place for me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am so grateful for the small class sizes, and our close relationship to our instructors and classmates.&amp;nbsp; I love that every class I have taken since freshman year has been applicable to both my degree and future position.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s also exciting to be a part of a program that is so coveted nationwide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am excited to use my position to make people feel comforted and cared for, on what is possibly their worst day ever.&amp;nbsp; I believe this is something that a lot of people feel they don&amp;rsquo;t receive during their healthcare experience.&amp;nbsp; I am also looking forward to using ultrasound for prospective treatments currently in research such as, treating cancers and degenerative diseases like Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before I start my family, I think it would be amazing to use ultrasound to see the world and be a traveling sonographer in English speaking countries.&amp;nbsp; I would also like to continue my career in a women&amp;rsquo;s outpatient center as a breast sonographer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In my pre-MIT year I was blown away by the level of education I received in my biology lectures and labs.&amp;nbsp; Every single professor went above and beyond to make sure we were prepared for our prospective programs.&amp;nbsp; In the DMS program, the labs have been my favorite.&amp;nbsp; Being able to spend time scanning on state of the art equipment with professionals in the field truly sets Oregon Tech apart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish that high school students could know how beneficial going to a technical school over a state school really is.&amp;nbsp; Everyone that gets through Oregon Tech&amp;rsquo;s imaging programs will have high paying jobs as soon as they graduate.&amp;nbsp; I also wish students in the Northwest could know how highly respected an education at Oregon Tech is through an employer&amp;rsquo;s eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am involved in the DMS Club at Oregon Tech.&amp;nbsp; It is an amazing opportunity to do fun things as a group within my program and really get to know my classmates.&amp;nbsp; We have the opportunity to raise money for charities we care about through events like bake sales, and garage sales.&amp;nbsp; We also volunteer in our community to help clean up the roads around campus.&amp;nbsp; I have also loved participating in intramural volleyball and the outdoor program&amp;rsquo;s ski trips.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to my externship at a hospital for my entire senior year.&amp;nbsp; I am so thankful that Oregon Tech gives medical imaging students the opportunity to work in the field while also working towards a degree.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The imaging programs at Oregon Tech guarantee an amazing placement at a hospital, and most likely a job offer at that hospital the following year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish that I would have made the decision to come to Oregon Tech sooner!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech because it was the perfect place for me to receive a great education with also the ability to be a part of the Track and Field team. The small class sizes and personable professors make OIT very unique and special.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love that I&amp;rsquo;m surrounded by professors and faculty that are very knowledgeable and supportive of me as a student, athlete, and entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love small business and have a passion to change the way people think about Klamath Falls and Southern Oregon. I see so many people come here to get there degree, complain about Klamath, then leave after graduation. I want to change this trend and use small business as a pathway to making the Klamath experience a more enjoyable experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;
What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am already living my dream job by owning my own business, Bulletproof Brewhouse. However, I would love to own a business that required me to travel the country and world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;
What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;
One of my favorite and most difficult was class was entrepreneurship. This class taught me so much about business as we were required to write a business plan for a fictional business. Not only did this class teach me a lot, but it was huge factor to the success of the opening of Bulletproof Brewhouse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would tell any perspective student looking at Oregon Tech to not listen to what people have to say about Klamath Falls or Oregon Tech. I would push them to make their own opinions and to be the change. Don&amp;rsquo;t get caught up living the status quo; stand up, dream big, and be the change.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>At this point, there was no time to waste; Amanda started performing CPR. While waiting for paramedics to arrive she had performed 4 or 5 rounds of CPR.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;It was an average October afternoon when Amanda and her friend decided to escape studying to go eat lunch at a local downtown restaurant. Amanda, a senior in the Respiratory Care program at Oregon Institute of Technology (Oregon Tech), had already accrued a well-round base of critical care knowledge learned from her course work and externships, which came in handy this October afternoon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amanda and a friend had just sat down to eat when they both heard a loud crash.&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;It sounded like the crash came from the back of the restaurant,&amp;rdquo; Amanda recalls. &amp;ldquo;I looked around and did not see anything.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amanda&amp;rsquo;s friend thought someone had fallen down in the back of the restaurant. As Amanda approached the area where the noise came from she found an individual lying on the floor, unresponsive. Familiar with situations such as this during her time working at hospitals, she immediately checked for a pulse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;People were eating their lunch and not doing anything,&amp;rdquo; Amanda exclaimed&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After checking the individual for a pulse, Amanda continued examining the situation for any obvious clues why this individual was not breathing and had no pulse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amanda remembers thinking at the time, &amp;ldquo;[Their] head was slightly propped up and I didn&amp;rsquo;t know if they had hit their head or what had actually occurred.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As Amanda remained on the floor she looked around to see if anyone had notified 911, but, &amp;ldquo;People were still eating their lunches. One of the waitresses finally came over [to me] and stated they would call 911.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point, there was no time to waste; Amanda started performing CPR. While waiting for paramedics to arrive she had performed 4 or 5 rounds of CPR.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am glad I knew what to do,&amp;rdquo; stated Amanda. &amp;ldquo;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t my first time giving CPR- I have had to do it in the hospital before.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the paramedics arrived, they took control of the situation and started performing CPR as they were boarding the individual into the ambulance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;[The situation] was not how I pictured something like that happening,&amp;rdquo; Amanda explained.&lt;/p&gt;
Amanda is a graduate from Sprague High School in Salem, Oregon and currently at her externship at Providence in Medford, Oregon.</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I like that I get the opportunity to put the theory into practice with the applied experience part of the degree. </TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
I chose Oregon Tech because I wanted to attend a college with both good professors and a lot of emphasis on applied experience. I transferred from a very large University in Norway where my classes were huge, so the small class sizes and professor involvement was a huge deciding factor for me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like that I get the opportunity to put the theory into practice with the applied experience part of the degree. By getting to try out different jobs in the field of psychology I feel more confident that I have chosen the career that is right for me. Additionally, the professor involvement in my education is such a unique trait of Oregon Tech, and I feel like my professors really want me to succeed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am passionate about changing the process of integration of refugees, especially now that the refugee crisis is ongoing. I think that it is so important to take good care of the people who have lost everything, and are now coming to a completely new and unfamiliar place, so that they can become productive members of society. The exposure to new cultures is such an enrichment to our society, and we should treat it as such. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job would be to work with the integration of refugees in my home country. I have always been drawn to new cultures, and I feel like I could truly make a difference in people&amp;rsquo;s lives with this job. Working closely with a vulnerable group of people would require much of the knowledge, skills, and training I have attained during my time at Oregon Tech. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My very first upper division class, Behavior Modification, was my absolute favorite class! Not only was the professor, Dr. Loukus, a very passionate and amazing teacher, the material was so interesting. I learned so much about the reason why people behave the way they do, and how to make people behave a certain way. This class has been very useful in my job as an employment coach with the JOBS program at Oregon Tech, and I highly recommend this class. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish everyone knew about how awesome Campus Life is! I always feel so loved every time I step into that office, and people seem to genuinely care about how I am doing. The bird feeder is also located there, where there&amp;rsquo;s almost always free food available to all students. After getting involved with Campus Life I always have a place to go if I have a break between classes, need to study, or if I just want to hang out with some cool people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am involved with the Psychology Club and Psi Chi, the psychology honors society, Campus Life, and the JOBS program. I just recently got involved with Campus Life, by working on the New Student Orientation Team over the summer. Being involved on campus, and especially with Campus Life, has made my experience at Oregon Tech so much more than just school. Oregon Tech has for me become a place of not only learning, but also a place where I am having lots of fun, and creating long-lasting friendships. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I participated in an externship in Norway, working as a manager for a large restaurant. I gained a lot of valuable experience from this, such as management, HR, administration, communication, evaluation, and other skills related to psychology. Getting to actually use the concepts and theories I learned in class in real life made me feel so much more ready for life after graduation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I know that I want to go to graduate school at some point, but the Master&amp;rsquo;s program I am interested in requires two years of experience post-graduation, so my plan is to work in my field for a few years before applying. I am moving to Norway with my husband only a few days after graduation, and am currently in the process of applying for jobs there and I have some interviews lined up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I want students to know that it is never too early to start looking for externships, and local part-time jobs related to their field of study. The sooner you get your foot in the door, the more experience you have when you graduate and are looking for a full-time job. Utilize all the resources campus has to offer, take advantage of the free gym, the health center, Campus Life, and all the workshops and events happening. But most importantly, have some fun!&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;What did you like most about your time at Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Being at Oregon Tech was being in this environment where you are constantly iterating on your work and striving toward your goals. I was always in this loop of solving problems and finding better ways to achieve the task at hand. You don&amp;rsquo;t realize it at the time, but being in a place like that pushes you to be better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What did you like most about your profession?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Software Engineers are the rock stars of this generation. Not only are we paid extremely well, but we work in a fast-paced, cutting-edge profession where each day brings new challenges. This constant evolution is what drives me every day to be excited about the work I do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How long after graduation did it take you to find a job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I signed to IGT in February (4 months before graduation), and started work a month after graduation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How do you feel your time at Oregon Tech prepared you for your current job/continuing studies?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;While no program of study can prepare you for everything, Oregon Tech gave me the building blocks that I needed to be able to transition into a fairly complex role within the industry. The leadership positions that I held while at Oregon Tech gave me communication and problem solving skills I utilize on a daily basis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you maintain professional relationships with any of your professors?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Professionally I stay connected with my professors through LinkedIn and OIT alumni events here in Reno. Personally I&amp;rsquo;m friends with all of my past professors on Facebook.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What advice would you give to a current student at Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Be the magic.&amp;rdquo; - Phil Howard. This holds true for just about anything in life. Don&amp;rsquo;t wait around and expect that things will be done for you. Go out and make them happen.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;What did you like most about your time at Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oregon Tech gave me the opportunity to make some lifelong friends whom I still chat with today and keep in touch regularly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your profession?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love the autonomy that I have. I work in several intensive care units, here at Children's, and every day we interact with different types/combinations of disease processes and utilize different ventilator strategies and I love that I am responsible for those ventilators and the changes that are made. We are a teaching hospital, so we round as a team, which consists of the attending, fellow, resident, RN and RT and we are the experts on our patients that need respiratory assistance, so we are often asked for our recommendation, as we are the expert in our field.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How long after graduation did it take you to find a job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I worked at Asante Rogue Regional coinciding with graduation, so it did not take any time at all. Once I moved to Massachusetts, it took about 6 weeks to get my license and about 3 months to find a job. During this time, I had several interviews but the hiring process was long. I interviewed at Children's in July and my official start date was not until the beginning of October. My advice is to have patience; good things will come!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How do you feel your time at Oregon Tech prepared you for your current job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;All those blood gas classes... you need them! All those long hours going over ventilators... you NEED them. We are the experts on the respiratory status of our patients and when they are on assisted ventilation, those countless hours studying over the waveforms, the modes and why you would use them, are essential in our daily work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything you wish you would have done during your time at Oregon Tech that you didn&amp;rsquo;t?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish I would have participated in some of the on-campus groups/activities more. I made some great friends within the program, but I think I could have expanded that network even more, if I had spared a few more hours to other activities on campus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What advice would you give to a current Respiratory Care student at Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do not be afraid to apply anywhere and everywhere. I knew I was moving to Boston and I wanted to work at Boston Children's Hospital. It was an ambitious goal, I had only worked at Asante Rogue Regional as a therapist for 7 months, and graduated from OIT one week prior to starting the trek across America. I applied everywhere that had an opening. While the interview process was grueling, I was beyond ecstatic that I was going to be a respiratory therapist at Boston Children's Hospital. I have worked here two years now and I am starting the process for a promotion to respiratory therapist II.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>You get a lot more one-on-one with your professors and it is easier to get hands on experience with less students. </TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;What did you like most about your time at Oregon Tech? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think it is a huge bonus that the class sizes in my program are small. You get a lot more one-on-one with your professors and it is easier to get hands on experience with less students. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your profession? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many qualities that I admire about the respiratory field, for one, the versatility of this career is exciting. This career path has so many different avenues that you can take. You can specialize and work in the NICU or the ICU, or the ED, or pulmonary rehab, to just name a few, it just depends upon what you are passionate about. I have enjoyed working in the ED during my rotations, I like the challenges that come through the doors. I am looking forward to being a part of an extra corporeal membrane oxygenation team in the future. This is another area that respiratory therapists can be a part of, which I am interested in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How long after graduation did it take you to find a job? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;While I am still pursuing my degree, I was able to get a job as an ECG/Respiratory tech at Asante Rogue Regional Medical Center, and through this job opportunity I have been able to gain valuable hands on learning in my intended field of work. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have not graduated with my degree yet, but I have found the hospital I will work at once I graduate and pass my boards. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Did you participate in any externships during your time at Oregon Tech? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a respiratory therapy student at OIT, I have done rotations at three hospitals so far (Sky Lakes, Rogue, and Providence). I am looking forward to going to other hospitals for my upcoming terms. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also participated in Respiratory Club events. I was the VP of the RCP club, so I had the pleasure of helping organize a group of walkers for a CF fundraiser walk in Sacramento, California. The club was a positive experience during my time at OIT. The club did many fundraisers and events. As an RT student I also did a smoking cessation talk at a local high school and I was able to be a part of the health fair/potato festival in Merrill. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How do you feel your time at Oregon Tech prepared you for your current job? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My current job is a tech at RRMC, and OIT had prepared me greatly for this job. In the job I currently hold, I was equipped with the basics from courses I took at OIT in my program. I was also able to use a few of my professors as professional references when I applied for the position. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;OIT is also equipping me to have a successful career as a respiratory therapist after graduation. In the program we take practice board exams every term, starting the spring term of junior year, and this is to help prepare us for the real boards. Taking the practice exams allows me to see where my strengths and weaknesses are currently, and it highlights where I need to focus my current studies to be successful in passing the boards. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything you wish you would have done during your time at Oregon Tech that you didn&amp;rsquo;t? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish I had attended more sports games. I only attended a few games towards the end of my junior year, but the games that I did attend with my friends were great experiences. Now that I am in my last year, I have moved to Medford to be closer to my hospital rotations, so I no longer have the option to just decide to go to a game last minute. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What advice would you give to a current Respiratory Care student at Oregon Tech? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Form a study group right away! Honestly, it is so helpful to have one of your peers explain a concept to you if you do not understand it in class. All of the professors are knowledgeable and willing to meet with you outside of class to help you succeed, but it is so important to have a study group of people who will hold you accountable. And just have fun, respiratory therapy is such an exciting career path.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have a passion for renewable energy.&amp;nbsp;Oregon Tech is the first school in North America to offer degrees dedicated to renewable energy&amp;nbsp;engineering. Also, I had heard about how beautiful Oregon is and I wanted to explore&amp;nbsp;Oregon's nature.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like the&amp;nbsp;focus on key renewable energy topics such as solar power, energy storage and other topics. Also, program prepares students to tackle real-life issues and situations. I also like the close interaction between students and professors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Applying renewable energy technologies has been hampered by cost issues and political considerations. I would like to see prices fall&amp;nbsp;down enough for renewable energy technologies to be even more competitive in the energy market. I would also like to see a political atmosphere that is more embracing to renewable energy in my county, Egypt, and around the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Minister of Electricity and Renewable Energy in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I liked the solar sequence very much. I acquired a lot of valuable information on solar energy and photovoltaics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have advanced equipment for manufacturing and testing of photovoltaic panels and batteries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would like to have a job in solar industry. At some point down the road I would like to enroll in a PhD program related to energy and/or sustainability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I love the sense of community present in the class cohort and with the professors; we help each other, cheer on each other's successes, and the professor’s exhibit a true joy in teaching.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oregon Tech came highly recommended to me by a professor at my community college. After researching the programs offered here,&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;graduate&amp;nbsp;employment statistics (high rates), and class sizes (small), it felt like a good fit. Oregon Tech provides the kind of learning environment and opportunities to its students that I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love the sense of community present in the class cohort and with the professors; we help each other,&amp;nbsp;cheer on each other's successes, and the professor&amp;rsquo;s exhibit a true joy in teaching. There is a distinct sense that the goal is for us all to succeed, and it's wonderful when everyone is excelling. The program also celebrates intelligence, curiosity, discovery, and general geek status, which is a joyful experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is need for enhancement of the relationship between the medical laboratory and other healthcare professionals. Often, whichever program one is enrolled in, there is little time for education about the realities and demands of other roles in the healthcare team. A little education and communication for both inside and out of the lab can make a remarkable difference in the expectations and relations on either side.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job would be to work in a specialization that I am excited about and where I can use my skill-set do the most benefit for patients. I am also interested in entering teaching one day, in a program such as mine, to help the next generation of laboratory scientists.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Choosing a short list of favorite classes is difficult; the classes I have taken at Oregon Tech have been pertinent, relevant, and exciting. Of the classes that I took to prepare for entry into my program: microbiology was my first real glimpse into the possibilities of medical laboratory science,&amp;nbsp;immunology is a fascinating subject with many facets, and the study of genetics has the potential for far-reaching impacts for patients. Now that I am in the program, all the classes I am taking are geared towards the medical laboratory science profession and as such, are highly specific to my future career. Each class is enjoyable, but the laboratory portion of clinical immunology and infectious&amp;nbsp;serology is a new adventure every week with a vast array of assays to run.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prospective students should know that Oregon Tech offers professors that are deeply invested in their students that will go above and beyond to help students and to support them, and are also excited to be teaching. All students should know that communication is highly valued at Oregon Tech; there are resources available to students that need help whether it's counseling, tutoring, financial, or even personal. The key is to communicate the need for help so that you can be directed to the appropriate resource.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In past years at Oregon Tech I have had campus jobs as a teaching assistant for anatomy and physiology and chemistry, as a library assistant, and as part of the leadership and planning committee for new student orientation (NSO). This year I have also been elected president of the MLS student club: ASCLS: OIT Student Chapter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this time I have not been on externship, though I will be wrapping up my time at Oregon Tech with one at the end of 2018. I have partaken in such programs in the past at other schools, and I expect that my MLS externship will be richly rewarding and highly applicable to my future career. The ability to gain real world hands-on job experience with the security of student status is invaluable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many ways to specialize in MLS, with many different excellent graduate programs across the country&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;I do plan to earn a Master's at some time in the future. However, I&amp;nbsp;see the potential for a better understanding of what studies I wish to pursue in the future by&amp;nbsp;having first worked in the field. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having now&amp;nbsp;attended courses at both the Klamath Falls and Wilsonville campuses, I am in the position to say that both campuses are great, for different reasons. Klamath Falls provides a more traditional campus, larger student body, more classes on campus, and many outdoor activities. While Wilsonville provides the more metro experience by being close to both Salem and Portland, and all the opportunities that come with living in a large city. It can be an adjustment,&amp;nbsp;with different benefits and challenges, to live in either location, but it's still Oregon Tech, with the same&amp;nbsp;high quality education and personal relationships with staff, faculty, and other students.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I love the one on one interaction with my instructors here at Oregon Tech. </TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I choose Oregon Tech because when it comes to education smaller is better. I love the one on one interaction with my instructors here at Oregon Tech. Plus how can you beat Oregon?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;To me the Mechanical Engineering Technology (MET) degree is the best balance between practical experience and theory. As an MET major I get to choose between Manufacturing Engineering Technology (MFG) elective classes such as CNC Machining (Computer Numerical Control) and Mechanical Engineering (MECH) courses such as Parametric Modeling better known as Solidworks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am passionate about re-inventing what people think is possible. Specifically, in the metal fabrication industry, by using modern technology and automation to push the limits of what is possible in fabrication today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job is to own my own precision metal fabrication and machine shop that specializes in achieving the impossible. Specifically, in the custom metal fabrication industry. This could be automotive based, industrial, or both.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sean Sloan&amp;rsquo;s Fluid Mechanics (MECH 318) class was hands down my favorite class so far. It was in this class that I discovered the true value of mathematics by learning how to control water and other fluids, something I previously knew nothing about, through the use of mathematics. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Catalyze Klamath Falls Competition last year was how I was involved on campus. This year it is though leading my own senior projects team of 7 (myself included) that I stay involved on campus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although I have not done any internship while at Oregon Tech, I have started two businesses and the experience has been invaluable. Currently I own and operate MOG Metalworks &amp;amp; Design and have found Klamath Falls to be an exceptional community for startups. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I will more than likely take on a part or full-time engineering job while continuing to grow my business MOG Metalworks &amp;amp; Design.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take the time to get to know your instructors! They are all great people that truly want the best for their students!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to take risks. Oregon Tech is a great place to push yourself to become a top performer.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText> Majoring in Medical Laboratory Science at Oregon Tech was the absolute perfect match for my career goals and aspirations.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;When I was in high school, I had the privilege of interning at a plant pathology lab. While there, I thoroughly enjoyed conducting experiments and carrying out laboratory procedures. Even though I have always known that my career aspirations were related to the medical field, Medical Laboratory Science was the perfect blend between the laboratory and my passion to be an outstanding member of the medical field.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Majoring in Medical Laboratory Science at Oregon Tech was the absolute perfect match for my career goals and aspirations. I have nothing but the utmost gratitude for my instructors&amp;rsquo; guidance and support throughout my program and I could not have completed this stage of my life without my parents, family, and friends&amp;rsquo; unconditional love and encouragement. Above all, I am blessed that the Almighty has provided me with knowledge, strength, and guidance during this journey.&amp;nbsp;​&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>Without the support of my family, friends, and MLS (Medical Laboratory Science)  instructors none of this would have been possible. </TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;Being a college graduate was never something I thought would or could happen to me. I did my life a little backwards. I married young, had a child and life just happened. In my early 30's I finally figured out what wanted to do. With the support of my husband and daughter I enrolled in community college. 5 years later and I've finally reached my goal and on Saturday, December 16th 2017, I became a college graduate. Without the support of my family, friends, and MLS&amp;nbsp; instructors none of this would have been possible. My time in the MLS program gave me the confidence of knowing that I had made the right decision 5 years ago. The instructors of this program truly want the best for all of us and will do everything they can to help everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>The courses of study in the MLS program is quite satisfactory, the lecture classes give me the basic knowledge about Medical Laboratory, and I can practice the knowledge acquired from lectures in lab days.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to do something more than just synthesizing chemical products in a lab, and actually serve the people and the community. The joint MLS program offered by OIT and OHSU caught my eyes among other search results, and it&amp;rsquo;s a lab related career.&amp;nbsp; While I can relate the MLS program with my previous lab experiences, and a career as a MLS would also enable me to serve the people and community. It&amp;rsquo;s simply a kill two birds with one stone choice for me. The courses of study in the MLS program is quite satisfactory, the lecture classes give me the basic knowledge about Medical Laboratory, and I can practice the knowledge acquired from lectures in lab days. This unique combination helped someone like me with almost no previous biology background tremendously. And now I&amp;rsquo;m so excited to begin my career as a Medical Laboratory Scientist.&amp;nbsp;​&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>My classmates are always willing to help me with studying or scanning, and my professors care about me and my professional success.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awards/Accomplishments while at Oregon Tech:&lt;/strong&gt; President&amp;rsquo;s List for six terms&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech because it is the only accredited public university on the West Coast that offers a bachelor's in Vascular Technology. OIT has a national reputation for producing the best Vascular Technologists, and I wanted to be a part of the prestige.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like how supportive and tight-knit my program is. My classmates are always willing to help me with studying or scanning, and my professors care about me and my professional success. I feel like an individual on campus, and not just a number, because everyone is interested in getting to know you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would like to establish a maximum number of scans that are allowed per day in order to protect technologists and their careers. Work related musculoskeletal disorders are common occurrences in this field and leave many technologists in pain or out of jobs. Having a limit will help technologists save their muscles from overuse and injury.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job would be an ultrasound technologist in a hospital. I would like to cross-train into Echocardiography after I graduate and be able to perform both vascular and heart studies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favorite class was the class involving peripheral arterial disease, because I love learning about arteries. I began scanning in this course, and while it was challenging, it was exceptionally rewarding. I could envision my future in this class because it prepares you to enter the real world and scan actual patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish everyone knew how open and supportive professors are at Oregon Tech. The medical imaging professors from all five programs support students in other faculty&amp;rsquo;s programs. They are always willing to talk and advise, even if the students are not in their program. I feel like I am a part of something and have people cheering me on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am the treasurer of the Vascular Technology Club and a member of Circle K. I also am a Peer Consultant and Supplemental Instructor for ultrasound physics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I could go back and do college over, I would form relationships with my professors earlier. Professors at OIT are friendly and love to talk with students, but I was too intimidated to visit their offices. They are valuable tools to use in order to learn more about the program you are interested in and to enhance your understanding of course material.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>What I enjoy most about the vascular technology program so far is how much I’ve been learning from the excellent staff and how supportive all the students are.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech because it was the closest and most affordable school that offered programs I was interested in. I was also attracted to their very high employment rate and how successful and prepared their graduates are. Another interesting thing that drew me to Oregon Tech is that my grandparents met there and I have other family members and friends that attended and spoke very highly of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I enjoy most about the vascular technology program so far is how much I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning from the excellent staff and how supportive all the students are. All of the information excites me because it is relevant to my future career, and everything related to the vascular system intrigues me. Cardiovascular disease is very prominent in our society, so that&amp;rsquo;s why I chose vascular technology to help do my part in helping patients and making a difference in this career field.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m excited to be a part of the process of helping people with cardiovascular problems get the help they need to be healthier. Another goal I wish to achieve in this particular field is to advocate for better cardiovascular health among our society. I would hope to inform and help avoid future cardiovascular disease since it&amp;rsquo;s such a massive problem in our society that can be better prevented with healthier eating and exercise choices.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job would be a vascular technologist at a hospital where I will be able to learn a lot, expand my job abilities, and potentially cross train for other similar jobs. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to work somewhere fast paced like a hospital, but it gives me comfort that there are different options, such as clinics, in case I ever have a family or have a need for more regular hours. It would also be somewhere warm and sunny, so I can spend as much free time outside as possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far one of my favorite classes has been cardiovascular physiology. It has been my most challenging class, but I really enjoyed the content of the course and I learned so much valuable information. This class showed me how much the staff wants us to learn so that we will be prepared in our future careers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish everyone knew how career and future focused the whole school is and how highly regarded all of their graduates are. If someone is able to find a subject at Oregon Tech that they are passionate about, there&amp;rsquo;s no doubt in my mind that they have the ability to reach their goals and set themselves up for a great future doing what they love. All of the students attending are very focused and the staff has the resources and knowledge to help everyone succeed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m an anatomy teacher&amp;rsquo;s assistant and also a tutor for anatomy and physiology. It&amp;rsquo;s very rewarding to try to help students be successful since I was in the same place only a year before. I also enjoy informing students about the vascular technology program because many students are unaware of all the benefits this career field has to offer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A major part of our program is having a year of externship for our final year before we graduate. Although I haven&amp;rsquo;t experienced it yet, I know that this externship is where I will gain the most skill and be able to apply what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned in a real life setting. Having a whole year to gain experience in a hospital setting and working with real patients is what prepares Oregon Tech students and makes them stand out to future employers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the moment all I know is that I want to start working right after I graduate. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that my externship is somewhere that I really enjoy, so that I can potentially get offered a job at that hospital. It would be nice to work somewhere close to home in Oregon, but I also have a desire to experience new places and see what other states have to offer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe one of the best ways to have a great experience at Oregon Tech is to find ways to be involved on campus, because it&amp;rsquo;s a great way to meet people with similar interests and also a way to keep busy and learn more about different majors. Even if someone isn&amp;rsquo;t certain on what career path they want to take, Oregon Tech provides so many excellent options and have many different ways to learn more about each major to help everyone find their best fit.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>Oregon Tech prepares you for an actual career that you can start the day after you graduate.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I knew I wanted to work in the medical field to help patients. I found that I am very good with technology and problem solving, and those things put together I found that an imaging program would be the best career for me that I would most enjoy. Also, I wanted to stay in Oregon!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love learning about human anatomy and physiology. It is such a relevant topic and I find it very fascinating to learn about things that are happening within yourself. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would like to practice medical technology with the patients' best interest in mind. I think healthcare has moved in a way where the world has started to treat patients like object that need fixing. I believe this field lacks empathy and I would like to be one person in this field that does not. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would love to work with a variety of people and perform many different types of scans. I would love to travel to different countries and work with communities where vascular technology is not typically accessible in order to help educate a community about potential health risks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed Cardiovascular physiology. Again this subject pertains to us all and it is very fascinating to see how our own bodies work!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish people knew that this isn't the type of school to just complete your bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree and go away. Oregon Tech prepares you for an actual career that you can start the day after you graduate. I&amp;rsquo;m a little bitter about this subject since I received my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree from another university in Human Physiology, but had no clue what to do after. That degree did not prepare me for the real world, but Oregon Tech does prepare you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;d like to tell students to really take the time to know what each career would be like before choosing a major. Go shadow all the jobs you think you would like to ensure it is something you would actually enjoy. I did this after I got my first bachelors and wish I had done it a lot sooner.</Biography>

    <TeaserText>We have cameras and processing stations that give us real life applications to our field.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My mom graduated from OIT and I knew I wanted to study Nuclear Medicine so I looked into the program here. It was the best school and program I had ever seen. Oregon Tech is very student-oriented and will always want the best for my education. I couldn't have picked a better school.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love how hands-on our&amp;nbsp;programs is. We have cameras and&amp;nbsp;processing stations that give us real life applications to our field. The professors invest in your education and give you every tool you need to succeed and then some. We have the&amp;nbsp;privilege of&amp;nbsp;cross training into MRI, CT, Mammography, etc. so our program director implemented classes to help us achieve&amp;nbsp;those certifications. This program is truly one of the best.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I could change anything it would be the perceptions and market of Nuclear Medicine. It seems that most people either have no idea what Nuclear Medicine is or the name itself scares people off.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job is to be a Nuclear Medicine Technologist who brightens patients&amp;rsquo; days. If I can take a terrifying and&amp;nbsp;unknown situation and turn it into just a moment of bliss&amp;nbsp;I will. I want to be that person who brings even an hour of joy to all of my patients in a time of fear.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have loved all of my Nuclear Medicine classes. Learning how we image the way the body functions is truly&amp;nbsp;indescribable.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would just want everyone to know that when you go to Oregon Tech you have an endless amount of support and encouragement no matter what degree you choose.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, I am the ASOIT&amp;nbsp;representative&amp;nbsp;for the Nuclear Medicine club.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech for two reasons; small class sizes and hands-on education. Coming from a small high school, I knew I needed to be in a classroom environment like Oregon Tech. Class sizes range from 10 to 30 students in my major. Having small classes allows you to develop relationships with your peers and be able to have one-on-one communication with your professors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oregon Tech as a whole strives to provide their students with a &amp;ldquo;hands-on, real-world education.&amp;rdquo; This is very prominent within my degree. By providing this type of education, I have been able to apply the skills I learn in the classroom out into the real world. We are constantly working with local businesses, exercising our skills and creating relationships with business owners, which allows us to develop a competitive edge over graduates from other universities. I like that all of our professors are industry trained, it helps them deliver a customized teaching experience to students outside of textbook concepts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job would consist of working with small business to design and create creative websites and logos for their business.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s honestly hard to pick a favorite class! All of our professors do such a great job keeping our classes relevant and up to date. I really enjoy the classes where we have to go out and work with local businesses. It helps us develop a wide range of skills that are necessary for our degree, while at the same time, allowing us to see the impact that we have in our community.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>OIT has very nice teachers, who will go out of their way to help you if you are struggling with the material. </TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awards/Accomplishments while at Oregon Tech:&lt;/strong&gt; Awarded&amp;nbsp;FIRST Robotics Scholarship, President's List&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was looking for a college that gave me the options to go more in-depth into the field of computers, down to the components that make up our modern world. And OIT was the only school with the reputation and specific major that would best suit me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It allows me to get a few internships within my field of study during my time at college.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am fascinated by the progress of microprocessors and electrical devices. And want to further this progress by changing the way we approach battery technologies.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job would be at a work place where problems are constantly thrown at me and I am required to solve them. Not only that but managing and updating older systems that have already been put in place.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favorite classes so far have been digital logic 1 and speech. I like digital logic 1 because its teaching me the fundamentals that I will need to understand how the components of a computer communicate and share information. While speech has taught me important skills that I must keep reinforcing in work group&amp;nbsp;environments.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;OIT has very nice teachers, who will go out of their way to help you if you are struggling with the material.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am part of Latino club where we have meetings every week and talk about life on campus as well as events that we will be participating in, to spread awareness of&amp;nbsp;our culture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am looking to get a job in the semiconductor industry in either California&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;Oregon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oregon Tech is a great campus if you are interested in any technological field as well as medical fields. There are a lot of opportunities&amp;nbsp;to excel and get involved in campus.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I fell in love with the CSET department and became part of the family - I never considered going anywhere else after that.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awards&lt;/strong&gt;/&lt;strong&gt;Accomplishments&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;while&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;at&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Oregon&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Tech&lt;/strong&gt;: Outstanding Community Service Nominee&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I left my first college after one semester and moved back home. My mom encouraged me to keep taking classes while I figured out what my next step would be. I chose the Software program because I thought computers were &amp;ldquo;cool.&amp;rdquo; I fell in love with the CSET department and became part of the family - I never considered going anywhere else after that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;By far the greatest thing about the Software program and CSET department is the family atmosphere. The professors have an open-door policy so we can talk to them basically any time they&amp;rsquo;re not in class, they even host pizza study sessions and code parties. Our professors are so much more than just teachers &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;re life coaches, mentors, and second parents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are so many stigmas related to the computer science/engineering industry and I&amp;rsquo;d love to see those dissipate. Like any stereotype, a very low number of the people in CSET and in the career field actually fall into the basement-dwelling, anti-social, nerd category. I think it can make people undervalue and discredit people in the technology industry and&amp;nbsp;would be great if we were able to help turn the tide.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt;
My dream job is to be a user interface specialist or consultant. I love the design aspect of programming and I think that a lot of good programmers struggle with creativity. That's definitely my forte and I hope I can apply it in industry someday.
&lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt;
Honestly, my favorite classes have been those related to my Human Interaction minor. I've learned &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;much about communication and in my program, those aren't skills we capitalize on. I firmly believe that you can be the best programmer in the world, but if you can't be a good team member and have good communication with those around you, no one will want to work with you. I strive to apply those interaction concepts every day in school and at work.
&lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&lt;/h3&gt;
I'm a CSET Ambassador which means I help with CSET outreach events whether it's Code For A Day or going to community colleges in Southern Oregon to speak with students about transferring to OIT. I'm also the CSET Media Coordinator and help make graphics for the Purvine TV and flyers for events. I also work as a CSET TA and grader, for Athletics as tech support, and for the recruiting office. I previously worked in the Registrar's office and for Campus Safety. I'm also a member of the Society of Women Engineers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt;
I'm in the MECOP program and have gone on one internship. I worked at Portland General Electric as an IT Applications intern. It was an amazing experience and I'm so glad that I got the chance to work with such incredible people. For the first three months, I was on an all-intern team and we developed a web application for PGE employees. During the second half on my internship, I worked with the Business Intelligence teams.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt;
After I graduate, I'll go on my second MECOP internship and within a few years, I hope to explore the possibility of a graduate school in either a communication or management field.</Biography>

    <TeaserText>Every instructor I have had at OIT has been awesome and I think that made a huge difference in whether I would continue with the program or not.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was a student at PCC working towards an AAS degree. I had no clue what I was going to do after getting that degree because it did not transfer well to other colleges and I was wondering where I could go. I overheard an instructor of mine speaking to another student during a class break, and he mentioned that he continued his studies at OIT. I was still new to Oregon at the time and had no clue where OIT was so I looked it up, set an appointment with an advisor, and decided to become an owl.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The instructors. I hated school when I was younger because I hated my teachers... and I was slightly rebellious. However, every instructor I have had at OIT has been awesome and I think that made a huge difference in whether I would continue with the program or not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rock star. I tried that. It didn't work so here I am in school.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think my favorite class so far has been Small Group Communications. I didn't think I was going to like that class because I don't generally like working with others all that often. However, we ended up building a guitar that lit up whenever it was played and that ended up being one of my favorite classes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's an awesome school with awesome instructors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Make sure your degree transfers over. Wasting time at a community college sucks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>This school has an incredible reputation for its medical imaging degrees, which are the perfect combination of rigorous and rewarding.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h2&gt;Awards/Accomplishments while at Oregon Tech: &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cumulative 4.0 GPA and President&amp;rsquo;s List each term.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Human Interaction minor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recognized for earning a 100% grade in Cross-Sectional Anatomy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recipient of the Walker Family Foundation, Sky Lakes Medical Center Volunteer, Sky Lakes Medical Center Endowed, and the Winston Purvine Presidential scholarships.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech because of its prestigious programs in the field I wanted to pursue along with all the qualities I was looking for in a college. This school has an incredible reputation for its medical imaging degrees, which are the perfect combination of rigorous and rewarding. It maintains a small student to faculty ratio, and has an incredibly close sense of community among students and staff. Over the past four years, I have found that Oregon Tech was the perfect fit for me and would be a great college for anyone who values a quality education and a rewarding college experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The qualities of my program that I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed the most over the past four years have been the hands-on teaching style and the strong bonds that develop between students and professors. Since the first day I was accepted into the Nuclear Medicine Program, I have been learning not only through lectures, but through hands on being able to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; the things I learn about in class, and not many schools are like that. Personally, I learn best by doing, so the lab portion of the program and the rotations done at Sky Lakes Medical Center made the material easier to understand and provided a beneficial &amp;ldquo;real-life&amp;rdquo; application. With only 15 students in my class, I think the sense of family has been my favorite part about my program. We all started out as complete strangers, but over time, we grew into one big family. I&amp;rsquo;ve made some of the best friends of my life in this program, and that has been my favorite part.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am passionate about improving the patient care aspect of this field. Too many times patients in the medical field are viewed as just a number or a dollar sign by big corporations, and aren&amp;rsquo;t treated as actual people with issues and needs. My hope is to improve the patient care aspect of Nuclear Medicine by treating everyone with the respect and dignity they deserve.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job would be working full-time in a Pacific Northwest hospital or clinic that has a large variety of Nuclear Medicine exams, quality patient interaction, and opportunities to participate in new research trials in the field. I have always been interested in up-and-coming technology, so working in a place that puts cutting-edge ideas to work while still providing quality patient care would be perfect for me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think my favorite class has been Radiation Biophysics. I find the interactions between radiation and matter really interesting and the enthusiasm it was taught with made me excited to learn more about it as I continued through the program. Since our field involves the use of radiation every day, it is important to know the different interactions it has with human tissue and how to protect ourselves, which is what that class specialized in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish more people knew about the great professors at Oregon Tech. Since the class sizes are so small compared to other universities, your professors become close friends instead of just teachers. They have an immense passion for what they do, and that makes learning so much easier and more fun. During my 4 years at Oregon Tech, I have created relationships with my professors that will last long after I graduate. This is a huge, positive quality of Oregon Tech that sets it apart from other schools, and something I wish more people knew about.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently I am on an 11-month externship at Peace Health Sacred Heart Medical Center in Springfield, Oregon. During my externship I have learned more about Nuclear Medicine than I ever thought was possible, and it has been such a priceless experience. In under a year, I gained an immense amount of knowledge in general Nuclear Medicine, SPECT, CT, and PET imaging along with scheduling, administration and patient care that will make me into a great technologist. The professors at Oregon Tech prepare you incredibly well for the field you are pursuing, but I learned so much more on my externship that I could never have learned on campus, and those skills are invaluable.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;After I graduate in June of 2018, I hope to find a full-time job in the Pacific Northwest, but I will go wherever a job presents itself. I plan to be a Nuclear Medicine technologist for quite a while, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also always been interested in pursuing research opportunities or going back to Oregon Tech to teach in the program I graduated from.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think my biggest piece of advice for incoming Oregon Tech students is to love every second of your experience here! It is a fantastic school, and the time goes far too quickly. People told me that college would fly by, but I never believed them. Now that I am just months from graduating, I have realized how right they were.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>Oregon Tech was the only school that offered what I was looking for in terms of the breadth of the program and approach of the instructors.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have always wanted to learn how to write code. Oregon Tech was the only school that offered what I was looking for in terms of the breadth of the program and approach of the instructors. I learn best by diving right into the base principles of how something works and OIT starts you from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The instructors are all great. Whenever I have a question they are glad to take the time to answer it in a way that makes sense to me. The amount of knowledge that many of the professors have is incredible. I have found that I can learn an immense amount from them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am interested in taking new technologies and making them useful to everyday users. I am particularly interested in block chain development. Block chain is the technology that Bitcoin sits on top of. It is very exciting to work on projects and technology that have the potential to create positive change in the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently my dream job is to start a company with my family and friends. I would like to develop software related to either deep learning or block chain. Artificial intelligence is hot right now, it would a blast to be part of a team developing autonomous vehicles or software that can play GO.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Data structures was great because we developed a few games. It was awesome to be able to show my friends and family the games that I made for the class. Junior project is great too. Working on a team can be a ton of fun and it is exciting to build a unique project chosen by me and my team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it before I got here; Oregon Tech has an excellent reputation. Many of my friends have received internships or full-time positions at great companies. Oregon Tech grads have no trouble finding work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After graduation I plan on applying to a few grad schools. I would like to continue my education and gain competency in a more specialized part of the field.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oregon Tech provides an excellent education and the culture on campus is both friendly and professional. I am very happy with my decision to attend Oregon Tech. I started at Pioneer Pacific in the IT program. Pioneer is the school across the street from the Wilsonville OIT campus. It was somewhat of a dream of mine to attend OIT, it seemed like the emerald city to me. I worked through a few courses at Chemeketa community college and got accepted into the CSET program at OIT. I feel that OIT has given me so much opportunity to write my own destiny in terms of my career.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>The lab portions for each subject provide an excellent opportunity to practice everything we cover in lecture, and I love being able to obtain hands on experience.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech because the Medical Laboratory Science program at Oregon Tech is the only accredited training program for Medical Laboratory Scientist in the state of Oregon. It is a joint program between Oregon Tech and Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), and both of these institutions carry an excellent reputation. The 16-week externship, coupled with the academic reputation of both universities, was the key selling point for me.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of my favorite things about the program is the dedicated professors. Each of them is enthusiastic about their areas of expertise. The lab portions for each subject provide an excellent opportunity to practice everything we cover in lecture, and I love being able to obtain hands on experience. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;From my understanding, my cohort and general field is predominantly white. I look forward to further helping bring diversity to this particular field and further spread awareness about this fulfilling program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was born in Portland and I love the city. My dream job would be to have a position with (OHSU). This way I could help the community I have come to love whilst living in a part of the country that has so much outdoor activities to offer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far, my favorite class has been Immunology. I am used to laboratory bench work from my position at a toxicology lab, so I loved learning new lab tests and techniques in Immunology lab. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;After briefly witnessing other programs' classrooms and meeting some of the other students, I want everyone to know that Oregon Tech teaches everyone in very hands on methods. Visitors would even be able to walk by and see all the cool labs from the different programs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I will be participating in a 16-week long externship during the fall of 2018. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I graduate after my externship. I will have had the opportunity to practice everything I have learned in a clinical setting. And I hope this experience will better prepare me as a potential candidate for a full-time position with OHSU.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I want to bring renewable energy to the consumer and to the commercial user.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I actually chose the Oregon Institute of Technology for the Renewable Energy Engineering degree program. I completed a freshman year at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, but did not connect with a degree program. 5 years later, I heard about Oregon Tech, then immediately moved to Klamath Falls. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like all of the hands on experience and the in-depth physics and mathematics covering renewable energy concepts I have received during my 4 years at OIT. Students in the REE program have a large amount of lab work to complete, and sometimes 6 projects per term. I have also been fortunate to find like-minded students within my program to do homework with and hangout with during school. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I want to bring renewable energy to the consumer, and to the commercial user. There is so much free energy just lying around, waiting to be extracted for our uses. We need to quit thinking of solely large windmill farms and huge solar arrays when we think of renewable energy. Anyone can implement sustainable energy practices; we just need to be informed how to do it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Owning my own Renewable Energy company that helps people and business implement sustainable energy technologies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved REE 243 and REE 253. These cover motors and generators, and the introduction of power transmission. This is the bread and butter of renewable energy. Then actual REE applications like Batteries, Wind Power, Geothermal Power, Electronics, Thermodynamics, Fluids, etc... are all fascinating. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;We might not be in Portland, OR, but that is a good thing. We have less big city distractions, and have more time to get school work done. Instead of clubbing, we can do projects. We are also in a great test site for solar, geothermal, and wind energy resources. This is an ideal place to seclude yourself and learn renewable energy engineering. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was recently elected the President of my school club, the Association of Energy Engineers. We were formerly the Renewable Energy Engineering Club, but we decided to change our name to become more inclusive and multidisciplinary. We complete student projects every term, and go on school field trips to power plants and networking events. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have not participated in any internships so far while at Oregon Tech. However, I have gone to a large networking event of professionals in Portland called the Oregon Solar Energy Conference, and have visited Sequential Biofuels, the largest biodiesel manufacturing plant in Oregon. I have been to the Shasta Hydro Electric Dam twice, and have had numerous tours of the on campus geothermal plant and 2 MW solar array. All of these have taught me valuable real world experience. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Involve yourself with independent research while at OIT. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Join some type of school organization or school club.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Find friends to do study with&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I would like to bring new technologies and ideas towards expedition type operations.  </TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech because I live local and wanted to use my GI bill&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt;, but didn&amp;rsquo;t want to waste it on a random degree as I already have a degree in nuclear engineering.&amp;nbsp; Renewable energy engineering is a field with great promise for the future; if I choose to re-enter the workforce when I complete my degree. I&amp;rsquo;m using the information I gain to help reduce my carbon foot print and eventually be able to live fully off the grid, energy companies are too greedy and I want to be out from under their thumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do like about Oregon Tech in general is the class size and eagerness of professors to help and be involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to bring new technologies and ideas towards expedition type operations.&amp;nbsp; This would help reduce the carbon footprint and make energy management much easier in remote places such as the Himalayas and Patagonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dream job is to not work, but if I had the opportunity I would like to start something along the lines of an adventure camp carbon footprint reduction consulting. Consult with major expedition funders and companies to give them tools necessary to reduce their footprint.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Math classes are my favorite because they are straight forward.&amp;nbsp; Either you know it or you don&amp;rsquo;t, and you don&amp;rsquo;t have to write papers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hiking in this area is superb but I already knew that, I just wish more people knew that.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I choose Oregon Tech because of their reputation, they are known for their great ultrasound programs. Along with the great ultrasound programs, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too far from home and on top of that, I was able to run on the Oregon Tech track team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love how hands on my program is, we get to practice scanning real people every day. I also love that the program is small and that you really get to know your classmates as well as professors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the echo field you essentially get to save people lives by discovering heart abnormalities before they cause further damage. Helping better the lives of others is something that really drew me to this field.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what my dream job would be, I would really like to try a little bit of everything, maybe even venture out into some of the other ultrasound modalities someday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favorite classes have been the echo classes because they have a scanning lab with them, the scanning lab is always fun. I got to practice scanning for three straight hours, and I always enjoyed improving my scanning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish everyone knew how great the programs are here. Your program really starts to feel like your family here in Klamath Falls; they are always there to encourage and support you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My first three years at Oregon Tech I ran on the track team. I really enjoyed my time on the track team, it helped me stay focused by managing school and sports. I definitely recommend getting involved in sports or clubs!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I will begin my 11-month externship this July. I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to all the experience that I will gain with externship. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to be scanning real patients and learning new things every day.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>Being able to work on projects based on real life situations is useful for when the problem shows up in a real working situation.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dad, my brother, and sister-in-law graduated from Oregon Tech and they told me how great the school was. I did research on Oregon Tech, but once I was able to take a tour of the school, I knew it was the school for me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really like the hands-on work and real-life projects. The projects on based on real life situations that are going to happen at some point in my field. Being able to work on projects based on real life situations is useful for when the problem shows up in a real working situation.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am passionate about changing people&amp;rsquo;s views on what information technology is. Information technology is much more than the people who fix the computer when it breaks. Information technology is used for making decisions on everything in businesses. Information technology supports business.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job is to become an IT specialist. Being an IT specialist would allow me to help others out and keep me on my toes with the work being different every day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have really enjoyed the C# programming classes. I love making programs and troubleshooting the code for issues. There&amp;rsquo;s a joy that comes from getting a program to run with no errors that can&amp;rsquo;t be explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oregon Tech is much more than an engineering and medical school. Oregon Tech has a great business department that offers great degrees like marketing, management, health informatics, and information technology to name a few. I also want to mention that having small class sizes allows for students to get to know their professors and classmates and build connections with them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I work at the athletics department taking tickets for the sporting event. I really like the job because I am able to meet tons of new people. I&amp;rsquo;m also a tutor at the peer consulting center. I tutor in information technology and help students out with programming and other IT classes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I got an internship at Betty Lou&amp;rsquo;s Inc. the summer of 2017. It was a great experience and really got me excited to work in the field. I was able to demonstrate the skills I learned at Oregon Tech and even learn new skills.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;After graduation, I hope to get a job in Washington where I am able to display the skills that I have learned and work my way up the ladder to get to my dream job as an IT specialist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The classes aren&amp;rsquo;t easy, but the professors, classmates, and other faculty around the campus are here to make sure you succeed. Nobody wants to see you fail and are here to help you if you ask for it. I also want to mention that Oregon Tech has some great sports and you should definitely go to the sporting events.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I like having teachers that have been vastly successful in the workforce already, they bring much needed insight into this complicated industry of tech.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awards/Accomplishments while at Oregon Tech:&lt;/strong&gt; President's list for Fall 2017&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; I chose Oregon Tech because it works excellent with my full time work schedule and is the exact training path for my future career in the IT industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; I like having teachers that have been vastly successful in the workforce already, they bring much needed insight into this complicated industry of tech.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; I am passionate about changing the culture of the IT person being a closed off introvert, that you know you need around but steer clear of at the water cooler. I want to incorporate a culture of influence and professionalism for the IT guy to help make them a very valuable member of the corporate team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; Dream job right now would to be a Chief Security Officer for a corporation/government body that wants to stay a head of the latest security threats, and be at the forefront of a healthy defensive security posture.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favorite classes were Networking II and Information Security, both with Kris Rosenberg.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is the place to be if you are serious about being in the IT workforce.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you involved on campus?&lt;/strong&gt;If so, how?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; I am a part of the Cyber Security club that started last fall.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; I am currently employed full time, and am looking for ever expanding work opportunities before and after graduation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; I wish that I knew exactly what I wanted to do sooner in life. I did waste some time pursuing a degree in History that did not amount for much. I have always been very fascinated with technology and to be studying and learning what your passionate about the most, is the best way to learn.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>The program provides an excellent multi-faceted approach to understanding business concepts and information through real world practical applications.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awards/Accomplishments while at Oregon Tech:&lt;/strong&gt; President's list since Jan 2017&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The renewable energy&amp;nbsp;engineering program is the primary reason for choosing OIT, however after working through half of the program it became clear that engineering was not my calling and switched to the technology and management program where I have thrived.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ability to gain knowledge in a multitude of different fields surrounding technology. The program provides an excellent multi-faceted approach to understanding business concepts and information through real world practical applications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The way local communities in the NW deal with their waste. We dispose of our waste in such an inefficient manner and our current throw away mentality is unsustainable. I would like to help communities turn waste into energy and usable products for sustainable plant based food production.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;While attending a bio-fuel&amp;nbsp;conference in Portland, I saw a presentation from&amp;nbsp;Amy McCrae Kessler, whose company, Turning Earth, has an integrated system for organic waste that creates natural gas for energy and fertilizer for their onsite organic&amp;nbsp;pesticide&amp;nbsp;free industrial greenhouse. If I could start and manage a similar project in Lincoln city, that would be my dream job.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing classes with Matthew Search have been my favorite and most challenging classes. They opened the door to research and knowledge and how to incorporate those into presentable material.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The incredible amount of information and research materials available&amp;nbsp;through the&amp;nbsp;OIT library system. It has been invaluable in my continued standing on the President's list.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have used the OIT resume building and researched job opportunities presented through Jobs4Owls. I have also attended and plan to attend Bio-fuel conferences to network and hopefully find a company with whom I can work to make my dream job happen&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt;
I would encourage them to make note and use all of the amazing resources OIT has to offer. Advising, counseling, laboratory, workshop, computer and library are all of the highest quality and are easily accessible.</Biography>

    <TeaserText>The extensive online class offering and support allows me the flexibility to complete my studies with a minimum impact on my family life.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose OIT for several reasons. OIT has a great reputation including national recognition. The extensive online class offering and support allows me the flexibility to complete my studies with a minimum impact on my family life. OIT also provides degree programs in the areas that I am interested in pursuing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The subject areas are applicable to actual work scenarios and situations, rather than pure theory.&amp;nbsp;The program also includes a broad range of content which will provide a strong, extensive base of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am excited about making a difference as I return to the workforce.&amp;nbsp; My focus is positive changes that provide a supportive, focused environment for employees and business activities.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have two dream jobs.&amp;nbsp;The first is starting and running my own company. The second is leading a nonprofit that is making a difference in our community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Corporate Finance. I have over 30 years of work experience, which may have given me an extensive background to relate to this class. The examples were very relevant and enlightening. Business Law and Business Ethics were also very interesting. Again, the examples and cases utilized in the studies were excellent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;OIT provides the opportunity for a student to gain an excellent education in a range of studies. The class content is designed for success in the real world. Students willing to put in the effort will be prepared for success in their chosen field.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am undecided on whether to rejoin the business world or attend graduate school. I do have aspirations to acquire a Master&amp;rsquo;s Degree in one of several business areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The online class delivery and experience is much richer than I expected. I recommend that students that have difficulty attending classes on a campus consider the OIT online program.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>You’re going to have to work hard, the standards are high, but it will be well worth it! </TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech for its reputation and Environmental Sciences program. I liked that the class sizes were small and that an emphasis was placed on obtaining real world, hands on experience. I also liked that there were a variety of classes that would be offered to me, with many opportunities to get outside! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;All the field trips that I have been able to go on - these have made some of the classes that I have really enjoyed even more fun, and have been a great opportunity for me to get to know my classmates and professors. I also enjoy the variety of classes offered in the program, since they have helped me explore the various fields within Environmental Sciences and allowed me to develop my interests and future goals.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am passionate about changing how people view the environment as separate from us. This program has made me realize how connected we are to this planet, how much we have manipulated it, and how necessary it is to our survival. As a whole, people have moved away from how reliant we are upon the environment, and it is reflected upon how we treat it. While this is a big goal, I still have hope!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job would be working on the restoration of wetlands. Wetlands play a vital part in ecosystem stability, humans and wildlife depend and benefit from them, but they have taken a serious hit from development. I would like to have this job because it would combine the three things I really enjoy &amp;ndash; botany, hydrology, and wildlife.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My two favorite classes have been Ornithology and Botany. Ornithology was a blast because I got to learn about all the birds that come through the Klamath Basin and how to identify them, and went on an amazing field trip to the Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge in Eastern Oregon, where we went hiking, soaked in hot springs, and birded along the way. Botany was a great class because I had to build an herbarium, which is a collection of preserved plant specimens, which gave me the opportunity to go hiking in search of different flowers, and because we took a trip to the Redwoods and California coast that I will never forget! Both of these classes were amazing because of the enthusiasm and passion of the professors, and because it gave me a greater appreciation for the beauty of the Klamath Basin.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I obtained an internship the summer of 2016 as a Plant Ecology Research Assistant. This internship was local and it involved monitoring a Federally Endangered plant species that can only be found in Klamath Falls, and helping build rainfall shelters for an International Drought Experiment. I gained valuable experience from this internship, it helped me get accustomed to working long hours in the summer heat and taught me skills for working in the field.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re going to have to work hard, the standards are high, but it will be well worth it!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>The faculty here care about your success and are a great resource to every student.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech because of its close vicinity to my home in Klamath Falls, its low tuition cost, and of course the overwhelmingly positive experiences that my older brothers have had at the institution. All three of my older brothers chose Oregon Tech as their first college as well, and their path to success as a result of their education at Oregon Tech confirmed that this school is the right one for my academic and career goals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like how diverse and sociable all of the students and faculty are in the communication program. Because it is a relatively small program, the professors are determined to set each student on a path to success and are always willing to spend extra time to help you. And since the class sizes are often small, you can engage in meaningful discussions with your classmates and professor, which is not always possible in larger programs and universities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since communication studies is often perceived as too broad or not worthwhile, I want to prove that this degree is an excellent choice for many different careers, especially since almost every career involves communication in some shape or form. The field is admittedly broad, but thanks to the help of OIT&amp;rsquo;s faculty, students can focus on specific aspects of the communication field that are most relevant to their career. For example, I want to become a teacher, so my advisor and professors have helped create a plan for me and my specific career goals.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job would be teaching English to high school students. This job would involve everything I am passionate about: helping others, interacting with people daily, forming a sense of community, making a difference in young people&amp;rsquo;s lives, and sharing my love for writing and English. Earning my degree in communication studies (with classes focused on writing and literature) will allow me to then pursue a master&amp;rsquo;s in Secondary Education at another university.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favorite classes so far have all involved studying people in some way, such as my Interpersonal Communication class. In this class, we found examples of communication theories and applied them to modern day examples in various forms of media. I found that when I applied a theory from the textbook to someone memorable like Kanye West, I could understand these theories better and realize how they are relevant in our everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone should know just how many free events there are at Oregon Tech. There is almost always something to go to each week, and more often than not, there is free food at these events! The information they provide is always useful as well, and I wish more students would attend.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have a few on-campus jobs at Oregon Tech, which make my life so much easier. Instead of having to travel to another part of town to get to work, I can just walk across campus after class and start working! I currently tutor writing to students at the Peer Consulting Center, edit and review essays that students submit online, and work at the Learning Resource Center&amp;rsquo;s help desk. I am also involved with OIT&amp;rsquo;s Circle K club, which gives me opportunities to volunteer and give back to the Klamath Falls community.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;After graduating, I plan to attend Southern Oregon University in order to obtain a degree in secondary education. With the help of my advisors at Oregon Tech, I will have completed all of my prerequisites for this degree.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oregon Tech&amp;rsquo;s small size is actually one of its biggest advantages. The faculty here care about your success and are a great resource to every student. Do not be afraid to ask them for help!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>The campus in Wilsonville is small, but there is a great community of people here.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awards/Accomplishments while at Oregon Tech: &lt;/strong&gt;President's List all terms, Outstanding Non-Traditional Student Nominee, Media Producer for TECH Talks 2016 and 2017, ASOIT Communications Officer 2016-17, and ASOIT President 2017-18&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was in Southern Oregon and looking for a bachelor's degree program&amp;nbsp;in Health Informatics. Not only did Oregon Tech have this program available, but they also had a very high placement rate for employment after graduation. This meant moving from a place I had lived for 30 years, but the opportunities for employment in the Portland Metro area were so much better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like working on the team projects with other students the best. This is much more like a real work environment than just reading, doing homework, writing a paper, and taking tests. Group projects show me how talented the other students are in different ways. When we blend our strengths together, the projects turn out much larger than anything I could do myself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am passionate about protecting and improving patient access to healthcare. With the recent changes in healthcare policy, the future of our ability to get the healthcare we need when we need it is unsure. This means so much to me because my Mom is 93 and she is a retired nurse, and one of the reasons she has lived so long is that she always had good access to her choice of healthcare providers. I see so many people younger than her who are not doing so well and have difficulty with their health and paying healthcare bills.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job would be to make a difference in the realm of healthcare access and improved patient record processes. I do have a job waiting for me when I graduate and in that job I will be helping medical facilities remain stable so that patients still have a choice of where they can get the care they need.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favorite classes have been Statistics, Healthcare Info Systems Management,&amp;nbsp;Systems Analysis, and Lean Six Sigma. Statistics is just fun, I love seeing piles of data sliced and diced to prove or disprove assumptions. The other classes all involved team related activities, and those are the most gratifying for me to be a part of.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish they knew that the Wilsonville campus is a valuable contributor to the workforce in highly specialized and high demand fields. We have a very active student government, and student services really cares about the welfare of the students.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, I am very involved currently as the ASOIT President, last year as ASOIT Communications Officer, and Media Producer for TECH Talks on campus in 2016 and 2017. I also&amp;nbsp;serve on the Fiscal Operations Advisory Council, the Resource Budget Committee, and an officer for the Society of Women Engineers club on campus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have had two internships during my time at Oregon Tech. The first one in the summer of 2016 was at the Heart and Vascular Institute at Providence St. Vincent as a data reporting intern. The second one was the following summer in 2017 at Huron Consulting. After that internship Huron offered me a permanent position and I have accepted it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My plans are to work for Huron Consulting and grow my career with them. After settling in to my job, I will look for a suitable graduate school to get my masters in Health Informatics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt;
The campus in Wilsonville is small, but there is a great community of people here. Most of the students are commuters and it is difficult to get together with fellow students when everyone has a different schedule. It is advisable to join a club and get involved to meet other students.&amp;nbsp;This is part of why I am an ASOIT officer, so that we can provide opportunities for students to connect with each&amp;nbsp;other and with staff.</Biography>

    <TeaserText>The best part of my program is that it starts the students off the first term taking key classes.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was looking for a school that would allow me to really excel in software engineering&amp;nbsp;and set me up to do anything I want in computer industry.&amp;nbsp; Oregon Tech and Klamath Falls&amp;nbsp;also offered something completely different than any other college I looked at, and that was a down to earth&amp;nbsp;community dedicated to working hard at school and learning how to do the job right.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The best part of my program is that it starts the students off the first term taking key classes.&amp;nbsp; What this means is that even as a Freshman and Sophomore&amp;nbsp;students have a chance to apply to internships in Software Engineering.&amp;nbsp; By the time the student is a Junior they are ready to apply to major internships.&amp;nbsp; By the time the student is a Senior, they are ready to contribute to a company as a full time employee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am passionate about changing communication and leadership in this field because I feel that most people in the field struggle with one or both of these topics.&amp;nbsp; With my previous experiences, I am ready to affect serious change in a company struggling in these areas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job is to own a software company that enables people to promote their own content and chase their own dreams.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favorite classes have been Vector Calculus, Grammars, and Junior Project.&amp;nbsp; Vector Calculus was a very fun math class where I learned a ton and&amp;nbsp;I took the class&amp;nbsp;under Professor&amp;nbsp;Fogarty, who is one of my favorite math professors.&amp;nbsp; Grammars,&amp;nbsp;instructed by Professor&amp;nbsp;Howard, taught me a very new way to think about languages and computer science.&amp;nbsp; Junior Project has been very fun, as I work with a team to create a travel application.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish that everyone knew how hard the students work here, and how good of an environment&amp;nbsp;it is for preparing us to work for any company we could dream of working for.&amp;nbsp; The students are not great because they are all super talented, although some of the students are very talented;&amp;nbsp;the students are amazing because of how they work together and overcome huge obstacles&amp;nbsp;to learn and complete tasks that are well beyond most college students.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cross Country and Track Captain.&amp;nbsp; Peer tutor in LRC.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I participate in Google's Engineering Practicum internship during the summer of 2017.&amp;nbsp; I learned an unbelievable amount about software engineering and about myself from the experience.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;One valuable&amp;nbsp;thing&amp;nbsp;I learned was about&amp;nbsp;working on a team to create a professional software product that is ready to sell to a customer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take advantage of every opportunity.&amp;nbsp; Do not be afraid to work harder than anyone else.&amp;nbsp; Apply to your dream internships, and keep applying until they accept you.&amp;nbsp; Persistence&amp;nbsp;is key.&amp;nbsp; Also, I love the library, so check it out!&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

My current senior project involves desalinating&amp;nbsp; water to irrigate soilized sand for crop development.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job would be to work for some sort of travel company that would send me to different places all over the world to take data or something. I'd like to work in Japan, since I enjoy their language and culture. I'm almost business ready in terms of language use,&amp;nbsp;so I&amp;rsquo;d like to use those language skills somehow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of my favorite classes were my philosophy classes, like&amp;nbsp;Philosophy of Science and Adv. Logic, because I got to talk about deeper subjects than things Engineers normally talk about. I also enjoyed my Sci-Fi lit class, because I was going&amp;nbsp;through a weird poetry phase, and I got to write decent poem as a final project. I also enjoyed my PV systems class, because&amp;nbsp;our teacher enthusiastically taught us the material, and we got to do side research projects. I also studied abroad twice&amp;nbsp;in Japan, and I loved my Japanese classes so much I've decided to move there and work after I graduate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I plan to teach English in Japan until my Japanese is sufficient for working in a Japanese&amp;nbsp;engineering firm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish I'd known where the financial aid income refunds came from (mostly loans), so that I could have sent it all back to&amp;nbsp;my loan providers immediately.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The small class sizes, the low tuition cost, the location allows me to live at home with a short commute, and the focus on technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The small class sizes and the creativity surrounding programming in general. There are so many possibilities in the software realm and it is exciting to learn more about it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am passionate about Android apps mainly. Almost everyone has a smartphone and there is a limitless amount of apps for them all. I just like to experiment and make high quality, good looking applications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream is to be an Android app developer or a developer of Android; developing the GUI interests me the most. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Digital Logic has been my favorite class so far because Professor Phong makes it fun and interesting. Computers are amazing machines and actually learning how they function baffles me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The small class sizes. When I look at other colleges they have auditoriums full of students and here the class sizes are about 20 people. It&amp;rsquo;s more comfortable and allows you to ask more questions.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s affordable, has super small class sizes, is technology based, and is overall a great school.</Biography>

    <TeaserText>The professors don’t just tell you how you could do something, they show you how, and then have you go do it yourself.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;strong style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech, because I had an interest in technology all throughout middle school and high school. Through high school I built computers as a hobby, and was active in my school and community, helping others with tech related issues. This developed into an interest in software development, which lead me to Oregon Tech.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like that the program is so hands on. The professors don&amp;rsquo;t just tell you how you could do something, they show you how, and then have you go do it yourself. It is a really rewarding and eye opening process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would like to see people on the same page more often in regards to conventions and development standards. A big complaint I hear often is that people are unwilling to try development methods that make everyone&amp;rsquo;s lives easier, because they are stuck in their ways. I feel like this kind of stagnation hinders progress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would love to work somewhere that is developing software that is really beneficial to the general populace. There is plenty of software out there that is just a money grab. I would rather be working on something that improves people&amp;rsquo;s quality of life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt;
Data structures was simultaneously one of my favorite and least favorite classes, because it was so challenging, but also interesting. I have also really enjoyed Junior Project so far. It has been a lot of fun getting to work with other people that are passionate about software development.
&lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;How great the professors are. They really put in a lot of work to deliver an excellent learning experience. They make you feel like you are part of a community of professionals, not just another name on a roll sheet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t try to do everything alone, it can be very overwhelming. There are great support systems on campus from tutors to professors that want to see you succeed, don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to ask for help.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText> I was impressed with the hands-on courses, small class size, as well as their unique Renewable Energy Engineering program.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;After having an OIT representative visit my high school, I visited the both the Wilsonville and Klamath Falls Campuses. I was impressed with the hands-on&amp;nbsp;courses, small class size, as well as their unique Renewable Energy Engineering program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like its size. Asking questions in the smaller class setting is very unintimidating. Also, I have been able to get to know most of my peers and professors in my program quite well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would like to reduce the cost of living by making homes more efficient and reducing the price of residential&amp;nbsp;power systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Designing and building energy efficient homes with built-in additives&amp;nbsp;such as solar thermal&amp;nbsp;water heaters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Electrical Power is a very useful course that covers much of the information needed to get into the very large industry of electrical power. I really felt confident applying for a job with a power company after finishing this course. Also, Photovoltaic Systems is a very fun class that covers nearly every part of the PV industry from cell manufacturing to panel installation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The registrar's office is very friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. Having a&amp;nbsp;good relationship&amp;nbsp;and regular interaction with these people can save you many headaches during ones&amp;rsquo; time at OIT.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am an OIT Men's rugby player which has connected me to many peers outside of my own major. I also try and attend as many other events that OIT's many clubs host to support their causes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This past summer I worked at an electric bicycle shop where I was able to practice a wide variety of technical&amp;nbsp;and interpersonal skills. This internship&amp;nbsp;was gained by simply emailing the shop asking if they had any opportunities&amp;nbsp;for me during the summer. Smaller places are often overlooked during internship&amp;nbsp;searches and can be much easier to communicate with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I plan on working after graduation and began applying early Fall term applying to multiple positions every week. Currently, I haven't&amp;nbsp;been offered a position&amp;nbsp;yet but it is very early in the hiring process for the year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Connecting with peers in your class as well as those further on in your program can make many aspects of college much easier. Making friends wasn't something I put much effort into freshman year and I struggled more than I needed to that year. Now in my senior year, there have been multiple courses that I would have likely failed if not for my friends.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>It is one of the colleges that provide a more hands-on experience for students which I really like!</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awards/Accomplishments while at Oregon Tech:&lt;/strong&gt; I was one of the founders of Saudi Student Association at Oregon Tech&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;At&amp;nbsp;the beginning, I chose Portland to study English as a second language. I started looking for the best colleges for engineering in the west while I was studying the language&amp;nbsp;until I found Oregon Tech. I chose it because when I read about it I found that it is one of the colleges that provide a more hands-on experience for students which I really like! Also, Oregon Tech is one of only two colleges that has RRE major in the US.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I like about renewable energy engineering program is how it has the potential to help the environment and perhaps contribute to saving the planet by helping to stop global warming effects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream career is to be the Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources of Saudi Arabia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Math and Chemistry have been my favorite classes especially. These are the classes that I feel that I can understand and help others understand the materials more easily.&amp;nbsp;Also I feel that I could be more creative and get the most out&amp;nbsp;of my experience&amp;nbsp;in these scopes of knowledge!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, I want everyone to graduate from OIT. It&amp;rsquo;s the best school from my perspective. I want people to know that Oregon Tech students have a more hands-on experience while studying and actively learning how to apply what has been learned to get the most out of the learning experience!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m a member of the International Club and the Treasurer of the Saudi Student Association and looking forward to be the president of the SSA next year.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;After my graduation, I&amp;rsquo;m planning to get an internship and work for one to two years in the United States to get to&amp;nbsp;experience the&amp;nbsp;different dimensions of&amp;nbsp;my major in the workplace&amp;nbsp;then go back to my country and work hard for my dream job.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I feel like they are preparing me to hit the ground running when I get into the hospital setting.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
I chose Oregon Tech because it is one of the few colleges that offers a nuclear medicine program, and the program here far exceeds what other schools have to offer. The hands-on experience especially with a full year of externship clinical experience will set me up for success in my field.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
I love the close-knit feel of a smaller program. We are all here for each other.&amp;nbsp; Nuclear medicine is like a second&amp;nbsp;family.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt; There are so many advancements happening in nuclear medicine. I am passionate about being involved in the cutting edge of diagnostic medicine. Nuclear medicine is making incredible strides with new studies for Alzheimer's, cancer, and many others!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
My dream job would be working for a research and teaching hospital. I would love to be involved with clinical trials for new exams in nuclear medicine. I would also love to pay it forward by teaching other students in the future when I am settled into my career.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
My favorite classes have included patient care and imaging procedures. These classes give a very real look at some of the most important aspects of what I will be doing every day at work. I feel like they are preparing me to hit the ground running when I get into the hospital setting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
I wish everyone knew how much this school has to offer. It may be small but it is mighty. It offers knowledgeable professors who truly care for their students, real equipment to train on, and a full year of externship clinical experience for medical imaging students. Not to mention the outdoor life here in Oregon is absolutely beautiful!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
I am currently the President of the Nuclear Medicine club here on campus. I try to stay involved with the campus as well as my community. There are so many options for getting involved.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
I have spent time time doing clinical rotations at Sky Lakes medical center in nuclear medicine, CT, and MRI. They have provided be with invaluable experience. This summer, I will be leaving for a full year of externship as my senior year in nuclear medicine. By the time I graduate, I will have a full year of work experience under my belt making me a great job candidate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
I hope to get a full time job at a nuclear medicine department. I am an adventurous soul, so I am open to taking a job anywhere in the country. Adventure awaits!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
I wish I had known a lot sooner that Oregon Tech offered a full bachelor's degree in nuclear medicine technology. This program has incredible success rates for passing board examinations and job placement. They are truly invested in making sure their students have all the tools they need to succeed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>There was no better school for me than OIT where I get a top notch education in all the skills I would need to move forward with my goal.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I left the military I knew I wanted to keep helping people and working in healthcare. When I looked at how I might want to do that, I realized that building better healthcare systems will let people be more in control of their own health. I don&amp;rsquo;t think there&amp;rsquo;s any more help I could give than to try and give people more efficacy in how they are cared for. I also realized that there was no better school for me than OIT where I get a top notch education in all the skills I would need to move forward with my goal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you like most about your program? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fact that I can see why I&amp;rsquo;m taking every class I&amp;rsquo;m taking. Not everyone pertains to my particular goal, but everyone goes towards making me a well-rounded tech entrepreneur not just a guy who can work a computer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I want to give control back to the people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would be your dream job? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to work for EPIC health systems and moonlight as a free information advocate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love SQL programming; Lindy is an awesome teacher. I really enjoyed technical writing, which was a surprise actually. It gave me a whole new way to express myself and my ideas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That it existed and that it&amp;rsquo;s great school. People know about U of O and OSU, some even know about PSU, but not very many people realize that we have a great school right in Oregon that can help you become a mover and a shaker in the tech world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a dad so I have to give what free time I have to my 1-year-old. I want her to be able to see that hard work will get you ahead in life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m about to start working part time with OCHIN and I&amp;rsquo;d love to continue after graduation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is an awesome school with teachers and staff that want to see you succeed. There&amp;rsquo;s something here for everyone so try things out, because it&amp;rsquo;s rare that you get access to as many top notch labs and educators so take advantage.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>Externship creates a "whole package" experience to my education.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awards/Accomplishments while at Oregon Tech:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Circle K Club Vice President, Citizens for Safe Schools Mentor, Nuclear Medicine Club Member, a cumulative 3.8 GPA, AA in business administration, minor in human interactions, and I am a Ford Family Restart Scholarship recipient.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oregon Tech's reputation for excellence is second to none. The employment rate&amp;nbsp;for all the medical imaging programs, after graduating OIT, is incredible ranging above 90%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favorite part of my program is the year-long externship. I have learned so much during my externship and it has made me fall even more in love with nuclear medicine. I appreciate that the nuclear medicine program has high expectations for its students.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I want to be the best tech for my patients. So often people in the medical field forget how it is to be a patient. I plan to stay compassionate and empathetic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nuclear Medicine Technologist with a secondary certification in computed tomography.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favorite classes were my imaging procedures classes where we learned to perform the procedures we practice in a clinical setting. I also enjoyed my communications courses that went towards my minor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This school is for people who are ready to work hard and achieve their goals. If you take your time at OIT seriously, you will be able to have a career that you love and are very knowledgeable&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before externship, I was involved with 2 clubs on campus, the nuclear medicine club &amp;amp; Circle K (a community service club). I am also a TOP program member.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am currently on my 11-month externship with Kaiser Permanente in the Portland area. I have made leaps and bounds in my knowledge of the field through my clinical experience. Classes can never quite prepare you for real world applications, externship sort of creates a "whole package"&amp;nbsp;experience to my education.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The time at OIT is short and I would recommend to be as active as possible in school activities. Once you get in a program, keep your peers close, they are the only ones who can relate to what you are going through and can be a huge help to you.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>What I like most about the Information Technology, Management program is it’s so diverse.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech because it&amp;rsquo;s my dream school for my career choice. When I decided I wanted to be an Information Technology major, OIT was the obvious decision. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard nothing but good things about the school and was ecstatic when I received my acceptance letter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I like most about the Information Technology, Management program is it&amp;rsquo;s so diverse. It touches on a wide variety of different elements of the IT profession. It allows students to truly find their focus in the IT world, which I think is an incredible thing. Plus, the advisors are great!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I am passionate about changing within the IT field is making it more personable. What I mean when I say &amp;ldquo;personable&amp;rdquo; is that I want to make it more social and fun. I love the analytical skills I&amp;rsquo;m learning as well as the psychology &amp;amp; sociological aspects of working in a business environment. I think interactions with our coworkers and end-users is always very important in the end.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dream job would be anything that involved technology and music. I&amp;rsquo;m a musician who loves creating, performing, and writing music. So, being able to blend the two fields together would be awesome. However, I&amp;rsquo;m going to school to become either an Information Security Analyst or a Computer Systems Analyst.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would say my favorite classes so far at Oregon Tech have been MIS 145, BUS 215, and MIS 102. All three of those classes had great professors and great class content. I learned a lot about networking, business, data entry practices, and more great skills that I&amp;rsquo;ve utilized in my everyday work at my job.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I wish everyone knew about Oregon Tech is really how great of a school it is. With a wide variety of courses, disciplines, and opportunities it truly is an incredible school for anybody looking to grow academically.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am not involved on campus because of my work schedule, but I would like to be if I could. Like a lot of the students attending the Portland-Metro campus, I work full-time while going to school. So, being involved on campus is something I would definitely like to do if I had the free time. OIT offers a lot of great ways to get involved!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have not participated in any internships or externships while going to Oregon Tech but I am currently working in my career field. This has given me a lot of insight on my career and has let me utilize what I have learned at OIT in real life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it comes to what I want to do after graduation, I always like the idea of continuing my education and doing graduate school to get a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree. However, currently I want to graduate with my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, Management and then work as either an Information Security Analyst or a Computer Systems Analyst.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have the opportunity to go to Oregon Institute of Technology, do it. It&amp;rsquo;s an incredible school with everything you could ask for with a college education experience. Great professors, great curriculum, lots of great ways to get/stay connected, and many more. If you want to get a great education, go to Oregon Tech!&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>My favorite thing about my program is the professors, they all have many years of work experience and that shows in what they teach us.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech because they have one of the best civil engineering departments in the state. Also being from a small town the small class sizes really appealed to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite thing about my program is the professors, they all have many years of work experience and that shows in what they teach us. They also all know everyone by their first name and are always willing to help when you have questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really want to change how people are transported from place to place. The current system was not built to hand the amount of people that use it and I want to change that. If people can change how they use transportation then we might be able to end traffic jams, and who doesn&amp;rsquo;t want that to happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two &amp;ldquo;dream&amp;rdquo; jobs, the first is to be a race car driver and the second is to be a professional basketball referee. The more realistic dream job I have is to be a city planner for a small city in rural Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite class is pavement engineering. In this class I got to get my hands dirty and mix different asphalt designs. I also got to test one mix design for its resistants&amp;rsquo; to rutting as part of my masters project to see how it would perform in the real world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish everyone knew just how great this school is.&amp;nbsp; It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter who you talk to everyone thinks their major is the best major on camps, which speaks to how great all the professors are, even though civil engineering is defiantly the best major!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the current president to of the schools ITE (institute of transportation engineers) student chapter. As a member of ITE I have been able to travel across the country to attend conferences about transportation. I am also a student ambassador, so I give campus tours as well as help people trying to apply fill out there application and answer any question they have.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had three summer internships while at Oregon Tech. I have been a field engineer on a paving project in Denver, CO. I have also worked on the Hwy 53 realignment in Northern Minnesota, where I was field engineer during the construction of the tallest bridge in Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I graduate from Oregon Tech with my master&amp;rsquo;s degree in civil engineering I plan on going to work in Northern Oregon. I would like to work for a transportation firm designing intersections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one regret I have from college is not getting involved sooner. I wish I had joined ITE or any other club sooner, because I have had so much fun while being in a club I can only imagine what I missed out on. You also have more free time as a freshman and sophomore to do club events so join a club sooner than later.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I feel like I’ve gained more solid skills in one year here than I did in four years at my last school. </TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had heard a little about Oregon Tech in the past, but when I was given a tour and told what the programs were like, I immediately wanted to be here. On the tour, a professor excitedly pulled us into a classroom to demonstrate an experiment with light and reflectors they were preparing for their next class. The school and the professors are serious about helping you learn, and they&amp;rsquo;re excited about what they teach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a sophomore, I still have a lot to learn, but I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve gained more solid skills in one year here than I did in four years at my last school. Everything we do is hands-on, the professors are all highly knowledgeable, and the projects are just plain fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may just be a geek, but I feel like there&amp;rsquo;s so much technology has to offer if we know how to use it. I want to encourage people to learn more about technology and computer science, to show them that it&amp;rsquo;s not as scary or complicated as it&amp;rsquo;s often made out to be. When people embrace technology and tinker with it, they can create really incredible things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really want to do something that I can be proud of, something that has an impact on the world. I see companies like Tesla and SpaceX pushing the boundaries of what we thought was possible, or giants like Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft impacting the daily lives of billions of people. I want to be a part of something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Data Structures is my absolute favorite class. I had heard from everyone that had taken it before that it is the most difficult class in the program; If I didn&amp;rsquo;t truly want to be a software engineer, it would push me out, but I love it. I get to code and design these complex structures that handle and manipulate whatever data I can throw at it, and then use them to build games and even more advanced structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professors are all experts in their field, and almost every one of them has many years of experience in industry. Because of this, they teach differently than other schools. Where other schools focus on theory, we focus on understanding, practice, and implementation; We learn how to do what will be required of us once we graduate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m part of the RockSat-C program, which is part of the Gravity and Space club (GRASP). The team is designing and building several experiments that will be launched into space through a collaboration with NASA. As part of the software team, we are responsible for creating software that will run on Arduino and Raspberry Pi to collect and store data from several different experiments at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;valuable experience from them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently interning at an engineering firm in Wilsonville, and it&amp;rsquo;s the greatest work experience I&amp;rsquo;ve had. Before this, I had always heard horror stories about internships, having to fetch coffee and run personal errands, etc. It&amp;rsquo;s nothing like that, you actually learn valuable skills and make some real connections with people in your field, all while earning a pretty good paycheck. Don&amp;rsquo;t wait to apply for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My previous education was in the social sciences and it did not prepare me for an engineering program. Be prepared to work harder than you ever have, but it is 100% worth it. Becoming an engineer is the best decision I ever made, and Oregon Tech is a great place to study.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>OIT’s atmosphere is extremely welcoming, and unlike larger colleges, students and faculty have more autonomy and have closer relationships providing better education.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose Oregon Tech because its well known for its hands-on learning experience and smaller classroom sizes. This has allowed me to make deeper connections with my professors, and allows me to thrive in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like that we have full access to the lab 7 days a week and most hours of the day. This allows for students with all different schedules to practice scanning and work on assignments at their own convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The continuing innovation of ultrasound machines is something that I&amp;rsquo;m very passionate about. After I become an experienced cardiac sonographer, I would enjoy having the opportunity to connect with manufacturing companies to help improve ergonomic design and user interfaces.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working for a progressive hospital that uses cutting edge technology and serves a diverse population.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far echocardiography courses have been my favorite. I did also enjoy Cardiac Physiology which focused primarily on cardiovascular fluid dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish everyone knew about the OIT smartphone app before transferring. The app contains different sections that include a student feed, buying &amp;amp; selling, lost &amp;amp; found, and a housing section. At the time of my program acceptance I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of the app. I had difficulty looking for a place to live in Klamath Falls and wished that I could somehow connect with other students that were attending OIT. If I had known about this app, my transition process would have gone smoother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I am in the echocardiography club. We fundraise money for our program by volunteering work hours to the school and community.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OIT is a smaller university that is located in rural Klamath Falls. This aspect may not be so appealing, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re coming from a larger city. Before moving here, I had similar thoughts but ended up falling in love with the college and community. I also realized there are many benefits to its size and location. For example, OIT&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere is extremely welcoming, and unlike larger colleges, students and faculty have more autonomy and have closer relationships providing better education. Klamath Falls is also the sunniest city in Oregon and is geographically diverse providing great opportunity for outdoor adventuring.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I am very passionate about changing hydroelectric dams because dams can drastically change the ecology of the effected river.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked Oregon Tech because it was a small school and it had a Renewable Energy Engineering degree. There were also a lot of examples of Renewable Energy on Campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you like most about your program? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy the small class sizes. It allows you to really get to know your professors. I also love the hands on approach in the labs which really helps you get an understanding of the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very passionate about changing hydroelectric dams because dams can drastically change the ecology of the effected river. It also hinders the migration of fish. I am also very interested in algae based bio-fuels because I think it could be one of the fuel sources of the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would be your dream job? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would absolutely love to work in an algae based bio-fuels company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed electrochemistry because there was hands on activities in the labs and my professor was really passionate about the topics. We also got to do some awesome activities like dissecting a battery and creating our own solar panels from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your professors are really receptive to any ideas you have. I am currently working on my own semi-independent project with one of my math professors I had during my first term. Also, don&amp;rsquo;t dismiss the Rock. My Rock adviser is one of my best friends on campus and it is really nice just to have a nice place to go and talk to others. I think the Rock has helped me the most in my college experience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you involved on campus? If so, how? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am involved with the Circle K club. It is a club dedicated to community service and it is great for making new friends. I highly recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure that you really want to go into the field you choose because college isn&amp;rsquo;t cheap. Also, be sure to have to some fun while you are at college. You can even have some fun by adding some humor into speeches or papers. This makes them a little bit more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I believe that the desire to constantly improve myself and never settling for where I am now fuels my success.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose this program (major)? &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My previous roommate had recommended that I switch majors to do accounting with him, causing me to switch from pre-physical therapy. His family members were involved in the accounting world and said it was a good career field to go into. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing in this particular field and why? How are you planning to use your degree in the future?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to change the misunderstanding that the only job opportunities with an accounting degree is to work a few months out of the year doing taxes. Although tax is a major portion of accounting, the degree can open doors into various business fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently I am using my degree to intern at JELD-WEN as a Junior Accountant, but I have accepted another job offer to work for ACA Compliance Group as a Performance Analyst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why did you decide to join TOP?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had previously joined the TRIO program at Centralia College in Centralia, Washington and they were helpful in navigating the college process. When I transferred to Oregon Tech I wanted to receive the same assistance in getting through my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oregon Tech is great for students since all the instructors and faculty are helpful. Professors here want you to succeed and have the skills necessary to find a great career. I have been able to drop into my professor&amp;rsquo;s office whenever I needed help and they are always willing to answer any question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is your favorite hobby, and do you have any experiences you would like to share regarding that hobby?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite hobby for most of my life has been baseball and is the main reason that I ended up at Oregon Tech. I had the opportunity to play for a single season and was blessed do so. I also enjoy trap shooting and team roping when I am back in my home town of Las Vegas, NV. Other interests that I have include weight training and jiu-jitsu when I have the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What fuels you to succeed?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that the desire to constantly improve myself and never settling for where I am now fuels my success. Taking this same mindset, I am constantly competing with myself whether it is in school, work, or whatever hobby that I am trying to get into. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who is your favorite professor and why? Do you know any interesting facts about that particular professor?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have several professors that I am quite fond of and that have been nothing but helpful. Two professors that I have interacted with the most and have put up with me for three years are Carmen Morgan and Richard Bailey. I know Carmen has more certifications than I have letters in my name. I know Richard farms in his down time. &lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose this program (major)?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was drawn to the REE program for its inclusion of a variety of engineering disciplines as well as the career field that it prepared me for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing in this particular field and why? How are you planning to use your degree in the future?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am open to a wide range of career paths but working in the power industry, upgrading our grid system, or in a number of renewable energy industries would be great. I think increasing the amount of energy generation by renewables is a direction we need to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why did you decide to join TOP?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College was a challenge much larger than any I had faced before, and I needed all the support that I could get. TOP has been large force in my success at Oregon Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oregon Tech is a tight-knit community where it can seem that you have connections with nearly every person on campus. This makes meeting new friends and finding resources very easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is your favorite hobby, and do you have any experiences you would like to share regarding that hobby?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite hobby while at Oregon Tech has been participating on the Oregon Tech Rugby Team. I remember taking a big step out of my comfort zone by going to the first practice but have never regretted it. I recommend reaching out to at least one group or club on campus your first week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What fuels you to succeed?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have goals providing for a family and succeeding now will make that a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who is your favorite professor and why? Do you know any interesting facts about that particular professor?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Sedlock was an inspiration. Even though he was past retirement he remained very enthusiastic about the subjects he taught.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText> I am the first person in my family ever to earn a bachelor's degree. I wanted to model for my children the value and benefits of higher education.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose this program (major)?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was local, had low student to faculty ratio, was an APA accredited psychology programs, applied experience, and has a 96% post-employment rate after graduation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing in this particular field and why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to advance the understanding of stereotypes and prejudices that are still prevalent for those who experience mental and physical disabilities, foster inclusive education for students who have unique challenges, and promote person centered counseling and case managing that is genuinely strength based. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How are you planning to use your degree in the future?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To advocate for vulnerable at-risk members of our community through a job in human services and or education. To speak publicly on the need to improve our services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why did you decide to join TOP?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew I needed their professional and personal services to help increase my successful completion of both my academic and social goals. They helped me stay focused on my goals and made sure I took care of myself and my family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are a student it can be easy to forget the incredible beauty that surrounds us on campus. I would encourage students to put their phones away and take the time between classes to chat with other people and look around, maybe hike the O or just remember to just breathe. Social connections and nature breaks can reduce anxiety an improve your quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is your favorite hobby, and do you have any experiences you would like to share regarding that hobby?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love heading to the woods, lake, or the coast. The long drive helps me clear my head, and nature rejuvenates my spirit. I am always amazed how much better I perform when I take a break from studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What fuels you to succeed?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desire to advocate and educate more effectively that can create a change in community mindset. I am the first person in my family ever to earn a bachelor's degree. I wanted to model for my children the value and benefits of higher education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who is your favorite professor and why? Do you know any interesting facts about that particular professor?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Petersen is one of my favorite professors. I really respect his integrity demonstrated in and out of the classroom, knowledge in our field, application of positive psychology, and accessibility to his students. He is a humble and patient man. &lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>Externship is just a long interview so do your best to show your site that you are a good worker and you will have a lot of doors open up for you</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Job Title &amp;amp; Place of Employment: &lt;/strong&gt;Registered vascular technologist at St. Luke&amp;rsquo;s Medical Center, Boise, ID&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;What did you like most about your time at Oregon Tech?&lt;/strong&gt; Making friends with classmates and being able to continue those relationships into our careers. It&amp;rsquo;s great having people that can relate to what you&amp;rsquo;re going through on extern and when you first start your career. It&amp;rsquo;s also nice to hear about job openings before they open to the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;What do you like most about your profession&lt;/strong&gt;? I like being able to see patients throughout their whole vascular process. Whether that is finding deep vein thrombosis and seeing the patient for check-ups until it is gone or seeing a patient with and acute arterial process in the ER and then following up with them after surgery. You get to meet a lot of people and you form a relationship with a lot of them because you see them multiple times a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;How long after graduation did it take you to find a job?&lt;/strong&gt; I had a job guaranteed before I graduated at my extern site. I was also able to get one of my good friends and classmate a job which is really cool to be able to have a classmate as your coworker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;How do you feel your time at Oregon Tech prepared you for your current job/continuing studies?&lt;/strong&gt; Oregon Tech really prepared me for my current job. I think that having a 1-year externship was crucial in being a good technologist. Seeing disease in books is a lot different than seeing it in real life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. &lt;strong&gt;Is there anything you wish you would have done during your time at Oregon Tech that you didn&amp;rsquo;t?&lt;/strong&gt; I wish that I would have taken my family to Crater Lake at least one more time while at Oregon Tech.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. &lt;strong&gt;Do you maintain professional relationships with any of your professors&lt;/strong&gt;? Yes, I actually just asked Prof. Leah Jolly for some information on arterial stents the other day. &lt;/p&gt;
8. &lt;strong&gt;What advice would you give to a current student at Oregon Tech?&lt;/strong&gt; Study hard and be prepared to work hard on your externship. Externship is just a long interview so do your best to show your site that you are a good worker and you will have a lot of doors open up for you. Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t get a job at your externship site, the vascular world is small and the people at your externship can refer you to friends at other sites.</Biography>

&lt;p&gt;Emphasis in hands-on learning. Classes are taught by PhD level instructors instead of TA&amp;rsquo;s. Small instructor-to-students ratio. Non-traditional student campus. Emphasis in polytechnic education. Cultural diversity &amp;amp; plurality are considered assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;

    <TeaserText>I plan on using the skills I have learned in school and in my own life for working with children.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose this program (major)?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I chose my major because I always liked psychology and anything that had to do with learning about the brain and the mind. Also, I wanted to work with children, and I knew that having a background in psychology would be helpful in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing in this particular field and why? How are you planning to use your degree in the future?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan on using the skills I have learned in school and in my own life for working with children. I would like to help them think about what they want to do in life, and then help them start on the path to get there. Most importantly, however, I would like to make sure they understand the work piece that will be needed to get there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why did you decide to join TOP?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I joined TOP because I was told that it could help me while attending Oregon Tech. After meeting everyone who works with TOP, I thought this would be an excellent place for me to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to pick something, I would say it would be the amount of time a person would need to study. One thing about Oregon Tech is that getting to the end of the road will not be the easiest thing for everyone, so it is best to study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is your favorite hobby, and do you have any experiences you would like to share regarding that hobby?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my hobbies is track and field. I have been running for about 9 years now, but there is still so much I do not know. For now, I am just going to keep learning, running and coaching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What fuels you to succeed?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say that I am a person who does not give up. Knowing that I have a young daughter who one day will look at what I have done in my own life, I would like her to see someone who is determined and never gives up. I hope that can help her in her own life one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who is your favorite professor and why? Do you know any interesting facts about that particular professor?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite professor is Dr. John Borgen. He was the first person I learned behavior modification from, and that has been one of the most important things I have learned while in school. &lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I had a few friends join TOP and they loved the supportive one-on-one attention they were given. </TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose this program (major)?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The answer just happened upon me one day. I was a student at City College of San Francisco, nearing the end of my general course work, and still unsure of what major I should pick or even where I was going to transfer. I came from a construction background, so the natural choice would have been Civil or Mechanical Engineering but neither of them spoke to me. After countless dead-end searches, I became frustrated by all the questions piling up on one another. So I headed off for a break at my favorite coffee spot, grabbed a paper, and thought a good read would help ease my mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While browsing through the paper I happened upon an article that talked about this technology called &amp;lsquo;Carbon Capture.&amp;rsquo; At first glance, it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem like much but the more I read the more enthralled I became. It was so fascinating that we could take such an active stance against global warming with this technology! As I continued to read, the article concluded with something around the lines of &amp;lsquo;&amp;hellip;and if this technology sounds interesting you should check out Oregon Institute of Technology&amp;rsquo;s Renewable Energy Engineering Program...&amp;rsquo; I was sold and applied soon after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing in this particular field and why? How are you planning to use your degree in the future?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology that brought me to Oregon Tech is what I&amp;rsquo;m most passionate about. Renewable Energy is all about using a resource that can be replenished without harming the environment. Taking a hazardous waste product and upcycling it into a useable eco-friendly material also has its place within Renewable Energy. I want to help bridge the technological gap between today&amp;rsquo;s technology and the innovations of the future. The devices of today will be around for some time after they have been outmoded, but the actions of today will also ripple long after we&amp;rsquo;re gone. Carbon Dioxide will be one of those long-lasting consequences of our action. That is why I am using the knowledge that I&amp;rsquo;ve gathered over the years to design and implement my own system that actively captures carbon dioxide out of the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why did you decide to join TOP?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a few friends join TOP and they loved the supportive one-on-one attention they were given. They&amp;rsquo;d tell me about the Coffee Connect hosted by TOP every Tuesday afternoon and one of the many guest speakers that have come to inspire students. There was even one time that they were able to go to Boeing for a tour! The thing is, even with all these amazing activities, what was spoke most highly of was the staff. They create such a welcoming environment and their doors are always open. This is why I chose TOP. It&amp;rsquo;s a great place to connect with people and the mentorship offered is truly invaluable. It&amp;rsquo;s a program that cares about you, not only as a student but as a person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The tools to success are offered but you must seek them out. There&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a learning curve to find all the resources specific to your goals. Once you find your road to success, it&amp;rsquo;s comforting to know how much support there really is for you. Therefore, I would suggest showing up to events held by the school because those human connections will take you farther than you think. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is your favorite hobby, and do you have any experiences you would like to share regarding that hobby?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small business development. It is extremely hard but learning about how to start my own business and helping others to do so is very satisfying. Right now I&amp;rsquo;m still in the infancy stages of my own business, but going out to generate interest, making the cold calls, and hearing people express genuine interest is truly rewarding. I still plan on keeping my day job and finishing up school though. So, in the the meantime starting my business is pretty much my hobby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What fuels you to succeed?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passion. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those things that&amp;rsquo;s frustrating because you can never get a straight answer of how to find it, but when you do you&amp;rsquo;re hooked. I count myself very fortunate to have found mine. It&amp;rsquo;s a passion that leads to success. We all fail, trust me I have, but if you have a passion you won&amp;rsquo;t care as much about the failure. You&amp;rsquo;ll care so much more about the success. It&amp;rsquo;s unfortunate that we&amp;rsquo;re conditioned to think of failure as a negative concept because without it we can&amp;rsquo;t adapt our way of thinking. When we&amp;rsquo;re able to change our mindset, the smallest victories fuel our drive to push forward. That fuel moves us past the negative side of failure and onward to using it as a constructive tool, leading to even more successes. Passion forces you to come to this realization, and it is passion that will set you apart in a crowded room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who is your favorite professor and why? Do you know any interesting facts about that particular professor?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michal Kawka. Although he is not a professor, the lessons he teaches students are eye-opening and inspiring. He&amp;rsquo;s able to share a perspective that is understanding but challenges you to expand your way of thinking. Edging you away from the quick answers with short-term solutions into carefully laid out plans that optimize the return on your time. As students, we can become so entrenched with just trying to make it through one class or one quarter. These short-term hurdles can often distract us from what really matters, life after the finish line. What happens after we make it out of college? Life doesn&amp;rsquo;t always hand us a syllabus to outline what&amp;rsquo;s to be expected, same as some professors you may have had. For some people the next step comes naturally&amp;hellip;but for others, they can become bewildered by this whole new process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of where you might stand, Michal Kawka offers a massive wealth of knowledge that will push you to reach your full potential. A side note, Michal is from Poland and speaks very fondly of home. The stories he shares are genuine and offer a glimpse into how people outside of the U.S. think. I remember how excited Michal was when he was first introduced to Marzena Terry, another Polish native. It was a treat to listen in on their conversation and I would suggest anyone stop by to talk to these two wonderful people. &lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I picked mechanical engineering because I like understanding how things work, and I wanted a chance to create new products that make a positive difference in the world around me.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;h3&gt;Why did you choose this program (major)?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I grew up playing with LEGOs, K&amp;rsquo;NEX and a lot of freedom in my dad&amp;rsquo;s woodshop. I was always coming up with new things and had a book of invention ideas. Throughout my years of school, I was given the opportunity to explore my creativity through the Gifted and Talented Program and then an intro to engineering class in high school. After I realized that I could use my math and science skills combined with my creativity as a career, I was hooked. I picked mechanical engineering because I like understanding how things work, and I wanted a chance to create new products that make a positive difference in the world around me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are you passionate about changing in this particular field and why? How are you planning to use your degree in the future?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to use my degree to pursue a career where I can work on new technologies or improve the ones we already have. I am passionate about all facets of sustainability. I believe that we can all live in such a way that does not damage our environment nearly as much as we do now, and I want to be part of the solution in changing these technologies and habits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why did you decide to join TOP?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to join TOP because I was in my high school TRiO program, and it was an incredible network for me. They helped me apply to 25 colleges, took care of the application fees, and provided me with an engineering internship during my senior year of high school. TRiO focused on making sure I knew my options and did everything they could to support me in reaching my collegiate goals. I could not pass up the opportunity to continue TRiO through college and have an amazing support system like this. TOP ended up being a valuable asset for completing my degree, so I am so happy I made that choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, we get stuck only hanging out with students in our own major. Oregon Tech has so many bright, friendly people - you just need to get outside of your comfort zone to meet them. I want others to know how welcoming Oregon Tech faculty and students are and that they should take the initiative to look outward for mentors or new groups to join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is your favorite hobby, and do you have any experiences you would like to share regarding that hobby?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I got into boxing, and I absolutely love it. I like that I&amp;rsquo;m staying active, providing myself with an outlet for stress, and having fun with people I never would have met otherwise in the Klamath Falls community. The group I box with is very welcoming, and I would suggest joining groups outside of campus for a variety of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What fuels you to succeed?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a first-generation college graduate, it is very important to me to have financial freedom in my near future. I also want to have a fulfilling career and life, so I keep that in mind while making important decisions like degree choice or which city I choose to live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who is your favorite professor and why? Do you know any interesting facts about that particular professor?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean Sloan in the MMET department has been my favorite professor since my first year. He is so passionate and energetic about engineering, and he passes that feeling on to his students. He is always willing to help with a specific problem or question, and he truly cares about all the students he encounters. Professor Sloan is obsessed with lasers, and he helped to write a book about the theory on how aliens built the great pyramids!&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>It’s amazing that I can help engineering students in a surprisingly large array of applications, and regularly see them receive help on projects and various computations from our math professors</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;strong&gt;Awards/Accomplishments while at Oregon Tech: &lt;/strong&gt;two terms on the president&amp;rsquo;s list; awarded membership with the National Society of Collegiate Scholars&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1. Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I liked the small class sizes, high success rate among alumni, amazing engineering programs, and an Applied Mathematics degree program that emphasizes engineering applications. The Renewable Energy Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering programs here all piqued my interest, so it sounded like a fun place to pursue my ambitions in Applied Mathematics, with potential to aid in engineering and design.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2. What do you like most about your program?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The emphasis on &amp;ldquo;applied&amp;rdquo; mathematics gives it a strong real-world connection to engineering and other fields with a powerful and fun conduit for collaboration. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing that I can help engineering students in a surprisingly large array of applications, and regularly see them receive help on projects and various computations from our math professors. Oregon Tech&amp;rsquo;s engineers (students and staff alike) are in turn willing and able to help math majors by conveying a different approach to understanding concepts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3. What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While I enjoy applying mathematics to engineering and other fields, I also hope to inter-connect the way math is used in other fields to expand their range of application. For example, there is a convenient method used in circuits (electrical engineering) that can be used to model/calculate traffic in a network of city streets and intersections (civil engineering). With this approach, I hope to create more versatile computational methods, and make it possible for more people to connect with and learn math in a more intuitive way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4. What would be your dream job?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It may not sound like an illustrious career, but I would love to be a high school and/or college teacher in math and physics. Connecting the way math is used in various applications will help relate it to more students and their interests, that way they&amp;rsquo;re less likely to dread mathematics or find it useless. During breaks and summer vacation, I&amp;rsquo;ll also be able to pursue research in engineering and aerodynamics (fringe benefit of being a teacher!).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;5. What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have enjoyed classes in physics, the calculus series, and Applied Differential Equations because even the most abstract concepts have tons practical uses in the physical world. Also among my favorites are mechanical engineering classes, particularly Engineering Mechanics (Statics &amp;amp; Dynamics), and Fluid Mechanics. There are lots of useful methods and perspectives for problem solving techniques used by engineers and physicists, along with a few handy tweaks in notation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6. Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There is a surprising large number of programs to help students here at Oregon Tech. These include the Tech Opportunities Program (helps low-income, disabled, and first-generation students), Career Services (to help get that dream job you&amp;rsquo;re going to school for), and Student Success Center (tutoring and academic help). Everybody should know that Peer Consulting is comprised of fellow students who can relate and are eager to help, backed by dedicated Oregon Tech staff. It truly is a community in its own right.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;7. Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, I help fellow students with their studies as a member of Peer Consulting Services in the Student Success Center here on campus. I have not seen a program like this at other colleges I have attended, so I really wanted to be a part of it. If you&amp;rsquo;re having a tough time with a concept, odds are a fellow student did as well and can likely provide guidance. The best students are the ones who seek help, so no need to fear that doing so means you lack intelligence in any way &amp;ndash; that&amp;rsquo;s the culture here at Oregon Tech!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8. Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I will most likely pursue a Master of Education degree so I can teach in public education, but not sure what school I&amp;rsquo;ll attend yet. Meanwhile, I may also teach night classes at a community college, work part time or as a consultant for an engineering company, or participate in research and development to offset expense.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;9. Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This level of education requires your A-game &amp;ndash; it turns out success is determined by your level of dedication to your chosen field of study, far more than just talent or how famous the school&amp;rsquo;s name is. An endeavor like this may sound daunting, but if you&amp;rsquo;re ready to go all-in, you&amp;rsquo;re also in for a lot of fun and rewarding experiences along the way. With a bit of discipline and an adventurous spirit, career success is just as good after attending Oregon Tech as the big super-elite universities.</Biography>

    <TeaserText>My dream job is one where I get to be a part of the design process in projects that break boundaries in sustainability and performance; I believe the two can go hand in hand.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;Awards/Accomplishments while at Oregon Tech:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Google Cloud Academic All-American (2018-19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2 x All-American in Cross-Country (2016, 2018)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; National Women's Cross-Country Champions (team award: 2018)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 3 x All-American in Track (2019)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Represented US in World University Games (2019)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &amp;nbsp;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having grown up outside of the States I was unfamiliar with many US universities, so it was Laura Schwartz (our recruiting coordinator for Cross-Country and Track) who introduced me to Oregon Tech. What sold me was the combined opportunity to compete with a team willing to develop me as an athlete and the opportunity to study engineering at a school with a strong hands-on program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &amp;nbsp;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like that engineering is the real-life application of science. It takes what we learn from our urge to ask why things behave the way they do and creates a how to solve a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. &amp;nbsp;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally engineering can be a little too focused on solving the immediate "problem." We do very well in making things run faster, be stronger, and go further but we don't always consider the end-of-life of a part or how we source the material we use and so on. I would like to be a part of changing that mindset so we can continue to do all these things but in a sustainable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. &amp;nbsp;What would be your dream job?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dream job is one where I get to be a part of the design process in projects that break boundaries in sustainability and performance; I believe the two can go hand in hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. &amp;nbsp;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've enjoyed the subject matter in almost all my engineering classes, but my favorites have always been those taught by professors who truly enjoy teaching and encourage questions. Sean Sloan, Irina Demeshko, and Joe Stuart are some of the professors that can make even a difficult class a fun one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. &amp;nbsp;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all that we're here! Hello? This thing on?! Also that we have quality programs and people here. Often after someone from Oregon Tech gets recognition outside the community, I hear the same whisper amongst the crowd: "who's Oregon Tech?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. &amp;nbsp;Are you involved on campus? If so, how?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am primarily involved on campus as a student-athlete and as a captain on the teams I have represented. As such, I am also a member of the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. &amp;nbsp;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal is to follow up this degree with a master's degree that looks at sustainable engineering. However, I am also looking for a job in order to help achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I think everyone should know is that being an underdog can be the best gig; it gives you the element of surprise! Being a part of a team and a community that is 'unknown' provides you with the opportunity to be one of the people that makes it known.&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>Oregon Tech has provided me with the tools to make a clinic more efficient while implementing best practices.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awards/Accomplishments while at Oregon Tech: &lt;/strong&gt;6 school records at Oregon Tech for track and field, All-American, 9-time national qualifier, Female Breakout Athlete of the Year 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;I chose Oregon Tech for the opportunity to have a hands-on education and to stand out to employers after graduation. There are incredible opportunities at Oregon Tech to grow outside of the classroom as well; internships, community involvement, and incredible outdoor activities. I toured many colleges, but Oregon Tech stood out to me as soon as I stepped foot on campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you like most about your program?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;I love the small class sizes; it feels like you&amp;rsquo;re getting a personalized education. The healthcare management program has given me opportunities to work at local clinics for class projects, building a network through the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The healthcare system in America is a broken place. Long wait times, overcrowded emergency rooms, I want to make sure that these issues can be solved and we are providing patients with quality care. Oregon Tech has provided me with the tools to make a clinic more efficient while implementing best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would be your dream job?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;My dream job would be a clinical director. I would love to provide guidance to employees on quality health initiatives, use strategic planning for growing the clinic, and provide an environment where the administrative staff is approachable and employees feel comfortable speaking up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The leadership classes at Oregon Tech have been my favorite. I have always been comfortable in a leadership position, but the tools I&amp;rsquo;ve gained through these classes have helped turn that passion into a reality. Not only have these classes taught me how to be an effective leader, but how to make a team one cohesive unit, so we can all succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;I wish everyone knew how much there is to do in Klamath Falls! Too often I hear people say &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing to do around here&amp;rdquo; but that&amp;rsquo;s simply not true. There are so many outdoor activities like hiking and winter sports, but there are also art studios where you can paint pottery, yoga classes, tons of great coffee shops, you just have to get out and explore!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you involved on campus?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;My campus involvement has been the Oregon Tech track and field team! It has been an incredible opportunity to represent our school as a student athlete. Every time I step on the track wearing my uniform, I am proud to be an Owl!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you participated in any internships or externships during your time at Oregon Tech? Did you gain valuable experience from them?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;I have participated in an internship at a local non-profit in Klamath Falls working with at-risk youth and teens. It has been an incredible eye-opening experience; I was able to apply so much of my knowledge from my classes to this opportunity. I developed a state-certified training program for the company to use for peer support services. This way they can partner with local clinics to get their clients the correct care they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have employment/graduate school plans for after graduation?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;I am planning on moving to Bend to work with St. Charles Hospital. I want to get a few years of experience before I apply for a master's program. This way, I will be able to refer to situations I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced in the field to gain a better understanding of the material being taught!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus, what you wish you knew before attending Oregon Tech or anything else?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;I wish I knew how many resources there are on campus! There are tutors for any subject you might need help with, a women's resource center, interlibrary loans, student health center, and so much more! Anything you might be struggling with, there&amp;rsquo;s a place for help at Oregon Tech. Everyone at this school wants YOU to succeed!&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>

    <TeaserText>I want to create a community within my hospital that provides efficient care to patients and respect across departments while also establishing a relationship with the people outside of the hospital.</TeaserText>
    <Biography>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awards/Accomplishments while at Oregon Tech:&lt;/strong&gt; Student Athletic Advisory Committee member, Dean's List Honors, All-Conference Women's Golf Honors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you choose Oregon Tech?&lt;/strong&gt; I first heard of Oregon Tech when I was being recruited for the women's golf program. I began researching the academic side and found they had the exact major I was looking for, Healthcare Management. It was a perfect fit for both my athletic and academic ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you like most about your program?&lt;/strong&gt; My program requires me to have a wide variety of knowledge and so I am required to take classes like Medical Terminology and then Database Systems, for example. The diverse selection of classes keeps me very interested in my learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you passionate about changing within this particular field and why?&lt;/strong&gt; Changing the healthcare system is near impossible for anyone, but my goal is to help lower socioeconomic communities have access to resources necessary for good health. This could include starting a clinic in an impoverished neighborhood, teaching kids in lower income schools, or reaching out to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would be your dream job?&lt;/strong&gt; My dream job would be a CEO of a hospital. I want to create a community within my hospital that provides efficient care to patients and respect across departments while also establishing a relationship with the people outside of the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What have been some of your favorite classes and why?&lt;/strong&gt; My favorite class has been Medical Sociology because it has taught me why different groups of people get sick and what affects them more or less. This interests me because I enjoy looking at the trends and how they change over time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything about Oregon Tech that you wish everyone knew about?&lt;/strong&gt; I wish everyone knew about the Women's Golf program and our recent success these last couple years!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you involved on campus?&lt;/strong&gt; I am involved in the Student Athletic Advisory Committee (SAAC), which raises athlete concerns to the university so we can build a strong relationship between the sports teams and the students at Oregon Tech.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything more that you would like to share with future students about campus?&lt;/strong&gt; Oregon Tech has something to offer every student on campus from robotic clubs, to Hawaiian club, to sports events! It really is great!&lt;/p&gt;</Biography>
